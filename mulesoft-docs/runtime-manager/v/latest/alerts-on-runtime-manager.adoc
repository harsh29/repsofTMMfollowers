image:alert-logo.png[alert]

[NOTE]
This feature is currently in Beta and not available for all customers.

== Overview


You can set up *Alerts* that trigger the sending of *emails* whenever certain events related to your application or servers occur. This mechanism works in the same way for applications deployed both to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[local servers].

Runtime Manager includes several out of the box *standard alert* types, for example:

* You exceed a certain number of events processed in a certain time period.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* The CloudHub link:/runtime-manager/secure-data-gateway[secure data gateway] gets connected or disconnected.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.
* A link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server] is disconnected or deleted

[TIP]
Creating a standard alert also creates a link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[notification] that will be visible when navigating the Anypoint Platform. Notifications are standard messages that appear in the Runtime Manager console to provide status information about your applications. You can access them via the bell icon on the top-right corner of the screen.


[NOTE]
CloudHub also lets you create your own *custom alerts* for your application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to the Runtime Manager console (using the link:http://mulesoft.github.io/cloudhub-connector[CloudHub Connector]). See link:/runtime-manager/custom-application-alerts[Custom Application Alerts] for more on this. Custom alerts are only available for apps deployed to CloudHub, you can't set one up for an app that you link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deploy locally].


== Access Alerts

To view and configure your alerts, you can:

* Select the *Alerts* tab to display a full list of alerts on your account
* On the *Applications* tab, click an application to open the link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications#applications-dashboard[application dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link
* On the *Servers* tab, click a server to open the link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#servers-dashboard[servers dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link

== Create an Alert

If you access the alerts screen through any of the paths listed above and you don't have any alerts set up yet, you will see the following screen:

image:create-first-alert.png[first-alert]

Click the plus sign next to *Create your first alert*

image:create-alert.png[create alert]

Fill in the required fields:

. Enter a unique alert *Name*.
. Select a *Severity Level* (Critical, Warning or Info)
+
[NOTE]
Different severity levels currently have no effect on alerts, but will in the future when further features are released.

. Select a *Source* to determine if this alert is to be related to applications or servers. This field may not appear if your Anypoint Platform account doesn't support link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[local servers].
. For applications, select an *Application Type* to determine if it is destined for applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub or local servers].
+
[NOTE]
You can't create a single alert that spans applications both on CloudHub and a local servers. You must create two separate alerts to reach both types.

+ For servers, select a *Server Type* to determine if you're managing a single Server, a Server Group, or a Cluster. If your servers aren't available on your menu, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].

. Select which *application(s)/server(s)* this alert should be applied to.
. Select the *Condition* that needs to occur for the alert to be triggered. The options depend on wether your alert is linked to a server, to an application running on CloudHub, or to an application running locally. Certain conditions require additional data, explained in a <<Alert Conditions, section below>>.
. Provide a *Subject* for the email that will be sent. Your subject may include variable <<Alert Properties>>.
. Write a *Message* to fill the body of the email. Your message may include variable <<Alert Properties>>.
. List the recepients of this email. You can select users of the platform, or also freely write email addresses of people who aren't in the organization.
. Click *Create Alert*.

. If a an event that meets an alert condition occurs, an email like the following is sent:

See below for more information on the alert conditions available for each alert source.

== Alert Conditions

Depending on what your alert's source is, different event types exist. Below are the event types for each.

=== Conditions on CloudHub Applications

On an application that's deployed to CloudHub, you can select any of these alert conditions. Some of these are self explaining notifications for different events such as 'Application Deployment Success', others require that you complete additional parameters that appear as new fields in the form.

* *CPU Usage* - refers to the CPU usage of the CloudHub worker(s) that run the app
+
image:cpu-usage.png[cpu]
+
You must then set up a few parameters for this condition to be enabled, these specify a duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert.

* *Memory Usage* - the percentage of total memory allocated to the CloudHub worker(s) that run the app (includes the memory being consumed by jvm itself).
+
image:memory-usage.png[memo]
+
You must then set up a few parameters for this condition to be enabled, these specify a duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert.

* *Custom alert* – looks at custom notifications and alerts when one contains a certain text
+
image:custom-alert.png[custom]
+
You must set up a few parameters for this condition to be enabled, these reference the notifications that are the output of a *CloudHub connector* that must priorly exist in your application. An alert is raised when the text in one of the notifications matches or contains the string that you provide in the *Contains* field. See the link:/runtime-manager/custom-application-alerts[Custom Application Alerts] tutorial.

* *Exceeds event traffic threshold*
+
image:alert-traffic.png[traffic]
+
You must then set up a few parameters for this condition to be enabled, these specify a duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert.

* *Secure data gateway disconnected*
* *Secure data gateway connected*
* *Worker not responding*
* *Autoscaled*.  See link:/runtime-manager/autoscaling-in-cloudhub[Autoscaling in CloudHub]
* *Deployment success*
* *Deployment failure*

=== Conditions on Locally Deployed Applications

On an application that's deployed to local servers, you can select any of these alert events. All of them are self explaining events such as 'Application Deployment Success'.

* *Application Deployment success*
* *Application Deployment failure*
* *Application Deployment status changed*
* *Application Deleted*


=== Conditions on Mule Servers


The available alert events vary depending on the *Server Type* field, that lets you select between Server, Server Group, or Cluster. All of the alert conditions are self explaining events that require no additional parameters.

== Editing Existing Alerts

If you view the panel for an application or server, you will see a *View Alerts* link. In there you will be able to see and manage the alerts that are sourced from it. You can also click on the *Alerts* link on the left panel to view all alerts together.

image:view-alerts.png[alerts]


From this menu you can filter the displayed alerts, click on an alert name to directly edit it, or click on the icon next to one to open its panel to view its settings. From this panel you can click the *edit* icon next to the name to edit the same options you have when creating a new one.

image:edit-alert.png[edit]



=== Switching an Alert Off

Select one or multiple alerts in the alert menu and click the switch to change its state form *on* to *off* or viceversa.

image:alert-on.png[on]

All users of the Anypoint Platform, even those without permissions to create alerts, can switch the existing alerts that are already created into an active or inactive state for their user. This determines what email alerts will reach their inbox.

[NOTE]
Switching an alert off has an effect for the user that is currently logged in, the state of the alert for other users is unaffected.

=== Duplicating an Alert

Select one or several alerts and then, from the alert panel, simply click the *duplicate* icon. You can then edit your new alert freely.
