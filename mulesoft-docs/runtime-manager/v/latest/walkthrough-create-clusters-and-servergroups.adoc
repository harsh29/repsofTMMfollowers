= Walkthrough Create Clusters and Server Groups
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, api

image:cluster_high_level.png[diagram]

This document walks you through the steps needed to configure a server in the Runtime Manager, and then add it to a Cluster or a Server Group so that you can deploy apps to multiple servers at a time.

To be able to walk through this scenario, you must have the following:
* An Anypoint Platform account that enables you to use the runtime manager
* Five servers on-premises that match the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements] to run Mule ESB. None of these servers can belong to any existing clusters or server groups.

Some preliminary - troubleshooting steps

when to use cluster / server group


The main difference between a cluster and a server group is that a server group is stateless whilst a cluster does keep track of server states. The servers in a cluster know what state the other servers are in, and so distribute the work load accordingly. Servers in a server group don't know what the rest of the machines are up to which may lead to less computing efficiency.ct

== Configure a Server

The steps below should be carried out for every one of the servers that you wish to use. In this walkthrough, we'll go through these steps on five different servers.

. Download the latest version of Mule ESB and unzip it on your hard drive
. Download the compatible version of the link:/runtime-manager/the-mule-agent[Mule Agent]
. Unzip the `mule-agent-[VERSION].zip` file to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder.

+
[NOTE]
If you happen to have a prior version of the agent installed and are prompted to rename or replace files, select `replace all`

. Log in to your account on the Anypoint Platform
. Navigate to Cloudhub and the correct environment, select the *Servers* tab, then click *Add Server*

+

. The Runtime Manager provides you with a default command that includes all of the necessary parameters to install Mule agent on a server and have it configured to work with your Anypoint Platform organization. Click *Copy* to copy this command to your clipboard.

+

. Open a command line window. CD into the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder
. Paste the command you just copied and run it

+
[NOTE]
Replace “server name” with a server name of your choice.

. At this point you should see a succes message. If you get any errors, check the troubleshooting section below

=== Troubleshooting

. Check to make sure your Mule instance on the server is running. Type `./mule` on the command line. If so, you should see a stream of messages

. If so, hit `Ctrl + C` to stop the process
. Verify that your Mule ESB version is compatible with the Mule Agent version you're using, check the compatibility matrix. If your versions aren't compatible, please download the correct versions and follow the steps above once more. If they are, please contact support.


== Set up a Cluster

. In the *Servers* tab, click *Crate Cluster*
. Select *Multicast*
(because bla bla)
. Select the servers you want to include in your cluster

+

+
[NOTE]
You can only select stand-alone servers (not part of a previous cluster/server group) that are online
. Click *Create Cluster*

+

. Wait for the servers to restart and come online again. You will be prompted with a success message

If you have already created a cluster and wish to add additional servers to it, follow the steps below:

. In the *Servers* tab, click on the cluster you wish to scale up
. On the side panel, click *Add Server*

+

. Select the server you wish to add
. Wait for the servers to restart and come online again. You will be prompted with a success message

== Deploy an app to a Cluster

. Navigate to the *Applications* tab
. Click *Deploy* to deploy an application
. Assign a name to your application and select the target, in this case the cluster you created

+

. Click *Choose file* to select the application you will deploy

+
[NOTE]
The file you assign must be a Mule .zip file. See how to export these files from studio in link:i/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/importing-and-exporting-in-studio[Importing and Exporting in Studio].

. Your application should now be deployed and come online


== Set up a Server Group

. In the *Servers* tab, click *Crate Group*
. Select the servers you want to include in your group
