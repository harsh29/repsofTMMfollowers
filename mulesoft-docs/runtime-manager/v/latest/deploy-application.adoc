[TIP]
This document deals with calling the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The POST method, specified with the `/api/applications/{domain}/deploy` resource (where `{domain}` is the application domain), allows you to deploy an Mule application zip file to CloudHub. This is commonly done after you've created the application in Anypoint Studio or using Maven from the command line- then you need to upload the actual zip file to CloudHub. After you've deployed the zip file, you can monitor the status of your deployment by link:/runtime-manager/logs[viewing the logs].

*Example Request:*

[source,json, linenums]

Â

*Example Response:*
