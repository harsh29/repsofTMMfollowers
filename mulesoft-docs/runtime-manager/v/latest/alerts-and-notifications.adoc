= Alerts and Notifications
:keywords: cloudhub, management, analytics, runtime manager, arm


[NOTE]
Alerts and Notifiactions is a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. It is not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

== Overview

*Notifications* are standard messages that appear in the Runtime Manager console to provide status information about your applications. You can access them via the bell icon on the top-right corner


*Alerts* give you the ability to trigger *emails* whenever certain events related to your application occur.

Runtime Manager includes several out of the box *standard alert* types, for example:

* You exceed a certain number of events processed in a certain time period.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* The CloudHub link:/runtime-manager/secure-data-gateway[secure data gateway] gets connected or disconnected.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.
* A link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server] is disconnected or deleted

Creating a standard alert creates both a notification in the console and an email alert action.

// check if this below is also for ARM

CloudHub also lets you create your own *custom alerts* for your application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to the Runtime Manager console (using the link:http://mulesoft.github.io/cloudhub-connector[CloudHub Connector]). For example, you can send a custom alert when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service.
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem with data mapping.
* You want to create a summary of what occurred inside your application, such as the number of orders processed.

Custom alerts differ from standard alerts in that you  receive a notification from your application inside the console UI regardless of whether you configure an alert.

[NOTE]
Custom alerts are only available for apps deployed to CloudHub, you can't set one up for an app that you link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[depoy to your own servers].


== Managing Notifications

Notifications appear by clicking the bell icon in the top-right of the Runtime Manager console. When you have new notifications, the bell turns red.

Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it. If the notification is associated with a specific application, the application name is also provided.
