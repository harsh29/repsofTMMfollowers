[TIP]
This document deals with calling the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The logs API allows you to search your logs. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's an example of what the result from a log search looks like.

[source,json, linenums]

      "message": "Deploying application to 1 workers.",
      "priority": "SYSTEM",
      "sequenceNumber": 1343797858127,
      "timestamp": 1344872571834
