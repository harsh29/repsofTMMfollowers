[TIP]
This document deals with calling the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

Use the GET operation on `/applications/{application}/logs` resource to list all log messages. This call returns a maximum of 10,000 lines of log data for each invocation. However, using repeated calls with contiguous time windows as search criteria, the entire log may be downloaded.

The following query parameters are supported:

[width="100%",cols="34a,33a,33a",options="header",]

|Name |Default |Description

|startDate |  |The start date to search for log messages. In ISO-8601 format.
|endDate |  |The end date to search for log messages. In ISO-8601 format.
|search |  |The text that messages must match.
