The CloudHub REST API provides a way for you to programmatically access much of the things you can do through the Runtime Manager. It allows you to:

* Create CloudHub applications
* Change CloudHub application properties, including the number of workers and environment variables
* Deploy a new version of your CloudHub application
* Delete your CloudHub application
* Get statistics about your CloudHub application

Before getting started with specific operations, be sure you're familiar with link:/runtime-manager/working-with-applications[Operations for Applications].

== Data Format

All resources or methods that return or accept a type use the JSON as the data format. As an example, here's data you might receive, in JSON format, in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json, linenums]
----
{
  "domain":"hello",
  "fullDomain":"hello.cloudhub.io",
  "workers":1,
  "hasFile":false,
  "muleVersion": "3.1.2",
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
  },
  "status":"STARTED",
  "workerStatuses":[
     {
       "id":"",
       "host":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
       "port":8081,
       "status":"STARTED"
     }
   ]
}

== Getting Started and Authenticating with the API

To use the API, you can use any HTTP client. All APIs use JSON as the data format. If you use Java, we recommend you use the link:http://wikis.sun.com/display/Jersey/Main[Jersey client] or link:http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html[HttpClient] with link:http://jackson.codehaus.org[Jackson] for JSON support.

All APIs require HTTP basic authentication. Your username controls which environment you're accessing and is of the form "user@enviornment". For example, if your username is jane and you have an environment called "Development", your username is jane@Development. If you don't specify an environment, it defaults to production.

== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the REST APIs, the following status codes are returned:

[width="100",cols="50,50",options="header"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (such as, application) was created. The Location header  contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (such as, server, server group, or deployment), a resource with that name already exists.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful. See the HTTP body for details.
|===

When errors occur (for example, a 500 status code), the HTTP response contains a JSON response with an error message. For example:

[source,json, linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT
 
{
  message : "Some error message."
}
