= Managing API Versions

This page helps you manage versions of your API in the Anypoint Platform. 

== Assumptions

This page assumes that either you are an Organization Administrator, or that you are signed in as the user who originally created this API in the platform.

== Creating a New Version of an API

You can create new versions of an API on the API Administration page. Browse or search for the API for which you want to create a new version, then click *Add New Version*. Note that this button is only enabled for APIs that you added to the platform yourself, or if you are an Organization Administrator. If you were granted API Version Owner permissions for an API after it was originally created, you cannot create new versions of that API. The platform prompts you for a version number and description for your new version. Once you submit, you land on the API Version Details page of your new version.

If you navigate back to the API Administration page, your new version is listed. Click the arrow to expand the full list of versions. Note that your most recently created version is at the top.

== Exporting/Importing API Versions

Once you have created an API Version, you can easily export it into a .zip file that you can then use to import into a new API Version elsewhere. This is especially useful when handling an API that is deployed to different environments (typically Dev, QA, and Prod). It saves you a lot of rework and eliminates opportunities for human error, as all you have to do to migrate or copy a version from one environment to another is to export it form one and then import it to the other.

You will find the export button on your API version page:

The exported .zip file will include the following:

* API name
* API version name
* API version description
* RAML files
* Policy state and definitions
* SLA tier definitions
* Images
* File attachments

[NOTE]
The total size of the exported file, with images and attachments included, is limited to 100 MB

You will also be prompted about optionally also exporting the following:

* API Portal
* Endpoint

You can then import this .zip file into a new API version. Note that you can't create a new API from an exported package, you have to first create a new API, then import the package into a new version of that already existing API.

[WARNING]
====
The name and version of the package you're importing can't match that of an already existing API version in your API, this would result in an error.

== Linking Multiple API Versions to a Shared API Portal

The new version of your API is unique. No description, tags, RAML definitions, SLAs, policies, or endpoints are shared between versions. However, you can choose to have multiple versions share a single API Portal. Using a shared portal can save you time if you have multiple versions that need the exact same documentation for developers. The only items that are _not_ identical in shared API Portals are:

* *the API Portal URL* – the portal URL contains your unique organization name, API name, and version number, so your developers have confidence they are accessing the correct portal for the API version they want to consume.
* *the API Console* (for APIs with RAML definitions) – even if multiple API versions share a single portal, the API Console displayed on a portal always matches the API version in the portal URL.
* *an API Notebook* (for APIs with RAML definitions) – even if multiple API versions share a single portal, any API Notebook displayed on a portal always matches the API version in the portal URL.

== Managing API Life-cycles

Change is inevitable, and your APIs are no exception. Managing the lifecycle of an API within the Anypoint Platform is a transparent and orderly process. For example, you don't have to create a new API in the system if you change the underlying data model; instead, create a new version of your API and document the changes. Other users with access to your API Portals can follow a clear path of transition to your new version while still having access to all the information of the older versions. 

If developers actively consume your previous version, you may wish to migrate them to your new version. You can quickly access the list of consumer applications by visiting your API Version Details page's *Applications* tab. Click each application to see the contact information for the developer who owns that application and communicate with them about your new version. To ensure their service is not interrupted, application developers can request access for their applications to the new version of the API before you revoke access to the older version. Applications can continue to use the same client ID and client secret for the new version of your API.

While you are transitioning consumers over to an updated version of your API, you may want to prevent developers from signing up for access to your old API version. In order to do that, set your old API version to *Deprecated*.

=== Deprecating Old API Versions

As an API administrator you can mark an API as deprecated which in turn will remove the 'Request API Access' button from the portal page. Existing application contracts will remain active but no new contracts can be created for that API version.

Deprecated APIs will have an indicator on the portal page (in place of the request access button) as well as on the API version details page. There will also be a badge in search results that will indicate that this version is deprecated.

As an API administrator you can also undeprecate an API if needed.
