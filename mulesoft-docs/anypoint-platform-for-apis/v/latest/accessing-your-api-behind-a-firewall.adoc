= Accessing Your API Behind a Firewall
:keywords: firewall, mixed content, cors, proxy, same-origin, anypoint, api console, api designer, api notebook

This page describes the Anypoint Platform for APIs' server-side proxy and how it affects calling an API behind a firewall. The server-side proxy is different from a proxy that can be configured for an API Gateway, and the two should not be confused with each other. The information in this topic is important to understand if you are calling APIs hosted on a network that prevents requests that originated from outside the network.

== Overview

When you use the Anypoint Platform's API Console, API Designer, or API Notebook features, calls to APIs are routed through a server-side proxy by default. For more information about this proxy and why it's used, read the <<Understanding Same-Origin, Proxies, and CORS>> section below. If your API is located behind a firewall that prevents inbound requests, the API is unreachable from the proxy and you won't be able to use the proxy to call the API. However, if you are using your browser from behind the firewall, you may be able to call your API directly. For more information about the different options you have to call an API behind a firewall, read the <<Bypassing the Proxy>> and <<Options for Avoiding Same-Origin Restrictions>> sections below.

== Understanding Same-Origin, Proxies, and CORS

The Anypoint Platform for APIs' browser tools (API Console, API Designer, and API Notebook) use a server-side proxy to make API calls to external domains. These tools use this proxy because it enables them to avoid the same-origin restrictions that are built-in on all modern browsers.

The same-origin restrictions work in the following way: when a browser makes an HTTP request to a domain and that domain returns a page, that page is referred to as the origin domain. Any scripts running in that page are only allowed to make additional requests back to the origin domain. If a script attempts to make a request to a different domain, under normal circumstances the response is blocked. This behavior is meant to stop scripts running in the page served by the origin site from gaining access to other sites you've visited before.

There are four common techniques that web sites and web APIs can use to avoid a browser's same-origin restriction:

. Use a proxy to funnel API calls through the same-origin domain
. Implement cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for the API
. Apply a CORS policy on a gateway that proxies your API
. Disable same-origin restrictions in your browser

By default, the API Console, API Designer, and API Notebook route traffic through a proxy. However, this doesn't work for all scenarios, especially those where an API is located behind a firewall. In this case, you need to use one of the other options to make your API available from outside the firewall. These steps are described in the <<Bypassing the Proxy>> and <<Options for Avoiding Same-Origin Restrictions>> sections.

=== Same-Origin Example

Let's consider a user who visits foo.com in their browser. When the page loads, two scripts start running. The first script attempts to dynamically load content from foo.com, which works fine. The second script attempts to load content from bar.com; in this case, the request succeeds, but the response fails because the browser detects that the requested domain (bar.com) is not the same as the origin domain (foo.com). 

=== Proxy Example

To demonstrate how the Anypoint Platform's API Notebook uses a proxy, let's consider the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/examples/twitter[Twitter example]. In this example, the browser makes a request to the following URL to get a list of Twitter followers:

`https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/proxy/https://api.twitter.com/1.1/followers/ids.json`

Notice that instead of simply calling the Twitter API directly, the desired URL is added as a parameter to the `/proxy/` endpoint in a request to the Anypoint Platform. This proxy makes it possible to make requests to a third party and return the response via the Anypoint Platform without being restricted by the browser's same-origin restrictions.

=== CORS Example

Let's consider an API that is hosted on an internal network behind a firewall. If you attempt to use the API Console, API Designer, or API Notebook with a proxy enabled, the requests fails because the proxy can't reach behind your firewall. However, if your browser sits behind your firewall and your API implements CORS, or if you have proxied your API on an API Gateway that has a CORS policy enabled, the requests to your API can succeed. This scenario works because the API Console, API Designer, and API Notebook tools are web applications that run in a browser, and because the browser is behind your firewall, they are able to make calls to your API if it supports CORS. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].

== Bypassing the Proxy

If you are trying to use the Anypoint Platform in an environment where inbound requests are blocked by a firewall, you have a few options to make your scenario work. The first step for each option is to bypass the proxy.

=== Bypassing the Proxy for the API Console and API Designer

Go to the API Designer for your API. On the right pane, check that the API is behind a firewall, which bypasses the proxy.

=== Bypassing the Proxy for the API Notebook

Go to the API Notebook for your API. In the initial code cell that creates a client, create a new code cell with the following code to set a new proxy configuration on the client:

*`API.set(client, 'proxy', false);`*

In the line above, `client` represents the name of your client that you used when you called `API.createClient().` For example:

*`API.createClient(<name of client>, ...);`*

Combining these two lines together, the following example creates a new client and then bypass the default proxy:

*`API.createClient('myClient', 'http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/my-client/api/test-api/test.raml');`*

*`API.set(myClient, 'proxy', false);`*

=== Understanding and Disabling Mixed Content Blocking

When an HTTPS web page retrieves resources from an unsecured HTTP endpoint, the resulting blend of secure and unsecure content is called "mixed content." Browsers block such mixed content and display an error because of the security implications. For example, mixed content introduces the possibility that a man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected malicious site resources (such as scripts) during the request and response. You may encounter this issue when using the Anypoint Platform for APIs, and it's important to understand how you can mitigate it.

The Anypoint Platform for APIs browser tools (API Console, API Designer, and API Notebook) are hosted on an HTTPS endpoint. This means that all requests and responses sent between your browser and the platform's servers are encrypted using SSL. In addition, if you're using the platform's server-side proxy, the proxy  makes requests to your API and encrypts the responses through SSL so that they can be displayed in the browser without triggering a mixed content error.

If you've disabled the platform's server-side proxy, any requests to your API are no longer routed through this proxy and are instead made directly to it. This situation isn't a problem if your API resides at an HTTPS endpoint, because all communication between the browser and the requested resources is encrypted using SSL. However, if your API has an HTTP endpoint, the Anypoint Platform for APIs browser tools makes requests to the unsecured HTTP endpoint and your browser blocks the resulting "mixed content" -- a mix of the browser tool's HTTPS (secured) content and your API's HTTP (unsecured) content.

==== Disabling Mixed Content Blocking in your Browser

Each browser presents mixed content errors in slightly different ways. Read the following support pages for each browser to understand how you can prevent it from blocking mixed content.

*Google Chrome:* See this link:https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1342714?hl=en[Google Chrome help page].

*Mozilla Firefox:* See Mozilla's  link:https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-content-isnt-secure-affect-my-safety[Mixed content blocking in Firefox].

*Internet Explorer:* See Microsoft's link:http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2625928[“Only secure content is displayed” notification in Internet Explorer 9 or later].

== Options for Avoiding Same-Origin Restrictions

After a proxy has been bypassed, your API still may not be accessible by the API Console, API Designer, or API Notebook because of same-origin browser restrictions. Your options for enabling access to the API are described in the sections below:

. <<Option 1: Implement CORS for your API>>
. <<Option 2: Proxy your API through an API Gateway and Apply a CORS Policy>>
. Disable Same-Origin Restrictions in your Browser

=== Option 1: Implement CORS for your API

If your API is behind a firewall, one possible solution is that you implement CORS for it. Make sure that you understand the security implications of any CORS configuration that you implement. For more information, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].

=== Option 2: Proxy your API through an API Gateway and Apply a CORS Policy

If your API is behind a firewall and your API doesn't implement CORS, a possible solution is to proxy your API through an API Gateway that itself implements CORS. For more information, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[Proxying Your API] and link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[Configuring an API Gateway]. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].

=== Option 3: Disable Same-Origin Restrictions in your Browser

Another possible solution, especially if you can't implement CORS for your API either directly or by using an API Gateway, is to disable the same-origin restrictions in your browser. Each browser handles these restrictions in a unique way; for example, after launching Google Chrome from the command line to disable the same-origin restrictions and then closing Chrome, your next Chrome session automatically re-enables the restrictions. Internet Explorer's settings persists across application sessions, so you need to change your Internet Options manually. Mozilla Firefox doesn't currently support a way to disable same-origin restrictions without using a custom build of the browser.

[NOTE]
Make sure you understand the potential security implications of changing your browser's security settings. You should only use these options for testing on your own web pages because your browser can become vulnerable to malicious scripts and other potential threats. 

==== Google Chrome for Mac OS X

* Open a new Terminal window, paste the following line, and then press *Enter*: `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security`.

==== Google Chrome for Windows

* Open a new Command Prompt window, navigate to the location of the Chrome executable (Chrome.exe), paste the following line, and then press *Enter*: `chrome.exe --disable-web-security`.

==== Mozilla Firefox

You can't disable the same-origin restrictions in Firefox without using a custom build of the browser's source code.

==== Internet Explorer

. Open *Internet Properties*, click the *Security* tab, and then click the *Custom level* button in the *Security level for this zone* section.
. A *Security Settings* dialog appears. Scroll down the list of security settings and locate the *Miscellaneous* section, and select *Enable* for the *Access data sources across domains* setting.
. Click *Apply*.
