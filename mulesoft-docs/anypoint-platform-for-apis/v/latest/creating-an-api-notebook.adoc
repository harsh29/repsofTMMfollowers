= Creating an API Notebook
:keywords: api, notebook

An API Notebook is an ideal tool for building interactive tutorials and examples to present to users of your API, and a handy way to execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes. The Notebook is a web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs. A Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it you can perform authenticated live calls to an API. The Notebook can call an existing API, as long as it's published behind an HTTP endpoint. Through the MockingService you can even call mocked APIs that are barely an empty shell to test out your API design.

Notebooks are composed of cells, which come in two types: *text* and *code*. Code cells are executable blocks of JavaScript, and text cells provide a neat way to display explanations and documentation. Text cells accept Markdown, so you can format your text to make it clear and readable. Any JavaScript is valid in code cells, you can even import JavaScript libraries and use functions from external libraries. +

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm, that states that the same code is meant to be human readable as well as executable.

== Assumptions

This document assumes you want to create an API Notebook, either for your own API or an external one. This document assumes you're familiar with the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis[Anypoint Platform for APIs] and have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language.

== Creating a Notebook

There are two ways to create an API Notebook:

. If you are an API Version Owner, edit your API Portal and use the left navigation menu to add a new API Notebook for your API version. Creating your API Notebook within the context of your API Portal automatically includes a line of code that creates the necessary API client for your RAML-based API.
. Visit the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site and create a new Notebook. If you want to save your work, log in with your GitHub account; your saved notebooks store as link:https://gist.github.com[GitHub gists].

== Sharing API Notebooks

To share an API Notebook that you create in an API Portal, you must share the API Portal itself. Either make the portal public or give other users permissions to view it. You can do this from the API Version Details page if you are an API Version Owner.

Notebooks that you create in the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site are saved as GitHub gists. To save a gist, log in to your GitHub account and authorize your application to write to to the gist. Then click the *save* icon.

To share or embed your Notebook, click the *share* icon. You are offered two links, one for sharing the URL, the other for embedding the Notebook in a site.
