= Building Your API 
:keywords: api, apikit, raml

In the New Enterprise, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) play a key role in synchronizing and streamlining communication between applications. Building a good API eco-system in an enterprise requires tools, helpful constraints, and guidelines to enforce good design practices and maximize the productivity of time spent coding. RAML and APIkit can help developers code faster, test efficiently, and provide documentation for end-users.

*RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/[RAML])* works to define RESTful APIs. Leveraging YAML and JSON, RAML is exceptionally lightweight, encouraging the organic emergence of elegant API patterns. Use RAML – and its link:http://raml.org/projects.html[intuitive tooling] – to design and write your API interface, then import the interface file into Studio to build out your API with APIkit. 

*APIkit* is an *open-source*, declarative toolkit specially created to facilitate REST API implementation. As a simple framework that caters to API-first development, APIkit enforces good API implementation practices. Rather than spending weeks or months building an API, you can use this toolkit to develop, document, and test an API within a few days or even hours. 

== Get Started with APIkit

. Study the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-basic-anatomy[Basic Anatomy of APIkit] to examine the parts that make up the whole.

. Learn by example. Follow the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-tutorial[APIkit Tutorial] to install APIkit, then build, deploy and test a REST API.

. Access link:http://raml.org/[RAML.org] to learn how to build your API interface using link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec[RAML] and its link:http://raml.org/projects.html[intuitive tooling].
