= Applying Runtime Policies
:keywords: policy, endpoint

Anypoint Platform enforces runtime policies on HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. You can apply or remove one or more policies to govern your API version at runtime. Anypoint Platform includes templates in YAML format that describe each policy and its configurable parameters. 

Policy-related features might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes[entitlements you purchased].

== Prerequisites

Prerequisites for adding, removing, and applying policies are:

* Permissions
+
API Version Owner permissions for adding and removing lower-level policies
+
* A link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[declared endpoint] for your API version
+
Policies can be enforced by the Anypoint Platform only for an endpoint that is registered on an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[API Gateway]. Thus, while you can apply and remove policies at any time after link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[setting your API URL], you must link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/deploying-your-api-or-proxy[deploy your API or a proxy application to your API Gateway] before those policies can be enforced.

== Available Policies 

The available policy templates are intended only for HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. If your API uses a Jetty inbound endpoint, all runtime policies function as expected except for the rate-limiting and throttling policies. These policies don't work due to a limitation in the Jetty transport. If your API requires rate-limiting or throttling, ensure that its inbound endpoint uses the HTTP transport protocol.

The Anypoint Platform for APIs includes the following out-of-the-box policy templates.

HTTP Basic Authentication:: Enforces authentication per the details configured in a Security Manager policy.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager]:: Injects an LDAP-based security manager into the target API.
Simple Security Manager:: A placeholder security manager that can be configured with a hard-coded username and password for testing purposes.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[External OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. You must reference an external application that serves as the OAuth provider.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider] (deprecated):: Configures an OAuth 2.0 authorization server at the target API. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement] (deprecated):: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement] :: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. This policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system.
link:/anypoint-platform-administration/setting-up-external-identity[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ip-whitelist[IP Whitelist]:: All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ip-blacklist[IP Blacklist]:: API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied.
JSON Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems.
XML Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious XML that could cause problems.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Throttling -SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Throttling]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting – SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]:: CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Client ID Enforcement]:: All calls to the API must include a valid client ID and client secret.

== Applying and Removing Policies

After you have declared an endpoint for your API version, the following tabs on your API version details page become active: Applications, Policies, and SLA Tiers.

To apply a policy to your endpoint:

. Click *Policies* to view the list of available policies for your organization. 
. Select individual policies to read their descriptions. When you have found the one you want to apply, click *Apply*.
. Depending on the policy that you have selected, you may need to provide further configuration. See detailed instructions for configuring one of the available policies:

** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP policy]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[AES-based OAuth policy set]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Policy]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/openam-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[OpenAM Policy]

If the policy that you want to apply has a disabled *Apply* link, it is not eligible to be applied to your endpoint due to either of these reasons:

* Another applied policy fulfills the requirement (see the Fulfills column)
* Another policy must be applied first (see the Requires column)

To remove policies, click *Remove*. The policies are immediately removed from your endpoint. To reapply the policy, reconfigure the policy. Your previous configuration is not saved.

== Setting the Order of Execution of Policies

If you installed API Gateway Runtime 2.2.0 or later in Studio and deployed your application to Anypoint Platform, you can set the order of execution of applied policies. At the top of the *Applied Policies* list on the API Administration version page, click the *Edit Policy Order* button to assign the priority.

== Configuring the APIkit Console for Policies

There are two ways to configure the console in APIkit:

* Policies are applied to both the API and the console.
* Policies applied to the API are not applied to the console.

The configuration of the console determines how the RAML-based, auto-generated proxy is configured.

In this configuration, the console and the API share the same listener:

`<apikit:config name="apiConfig" raml="api.raml" consoleEnabled="true" consolePath="console" />`

In this configuration, the console is hosted using it's own listener.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="console" doc:name="console">
    <http:listener config-ref="http-lc-0.0.0.0-8081" path="console" parseRequest="false" />
    <apikit:console config-ref="proxy-config"/>
</flow>
