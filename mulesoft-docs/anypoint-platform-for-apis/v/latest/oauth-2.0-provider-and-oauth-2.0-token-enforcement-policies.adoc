= OAuth 2.0 Provider and 2.0 Token Enforcement Policies

[WARNING]
====
Both policies described in this document are *deprecated* **as of API Gateway runtime version 2.0**. To apply OAuth in newer versions, refer to the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[External OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy].

If your organization uses PingFederate, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy].
====

This page describes the configuration and runtime application instructions for the OAuth 2.0 Provider and 2.0 Token Enforcement policies for the Anypoint Platform for APIs, these policies are only valid for API Gateway Runtime versions older than version 2.0.

The OAuth 2.0 policies require a Security Manager policy in order to work. To block unauthorized requests to your API, you must apply both an OAuth Provider and an OAuth Token Enforcement policy. Here is a high-level overview of how the policies work together to enforce OAuth 2.0 protection of an API.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are an API Version Owner for the API version that you want to manage, or that you are an Organization Administrator.

This document also assumes that you are familiar with OAuth 2.0. If you need a refresher, read this link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-secure-token-service[overview].

These policies require a Security Manager policy in order to function. You can use the Simple Security Manager policy for testing, or else configure an LDAP Security Manager. See the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager] policy documentation for how to configure a security manager against which the OAuth policies can authenticate. The OAuth policies also require that all applications have registered with API to which the OAuth policies are applied. Note that if your organization uses PingFederate, you should see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy] instead.

== Prerequisites for RAML APIs

If your API is defined using RAML (recommended), your RAML securitySchemes must be defined for OAuth 2.0. Refer to the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/raml-0.8.md#oauth-20[RAML spec] for details on defining this section. Before configuring your OAuth policies in the API Version Details page, determine any prerequisites and requirements determined by your securitySchemes definition in your RAML file.

==== OAuth Dance URIs

Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, you must include URIs for the authorization and access token. If you are deploying the API to a cloud API Gateway, you must configure the host and port as 0.0.0.0:8081 in your OAuth Provider policy on your API Version Details page.

.2+^.^| *URI in RAML*
2+^| *Configuration in OAuth Provider Policy for host and port*

| *for On-Premises Deployment*

==== Grant Types

You must configure your policy to match the grant types specified in your RAML securitySchemes. Refer to the table below for reference on how the grant type specifications in RAML map to the grant type names in the policy configuration.

|Authorization Grant Types Defined in RAML Definition |Equivalent Authorization Grant Type to Enable in the OAuth Provider Policy |Supported in embedded APIkit Console?
|`[token]` |Implicit |Yes
|`[credentials]` |Client Credentials |No
|`[owner]` |Resource Owner Password Credentials |No
|`[code]` |Authorization Code |Yes
|===

== Configuring an OAuth 2.0 Provider Policy

Configure the OAuth 2.0 Provider as shown. All fields are required, except for the Description and Scopes.

[width="100a",cols="10a,80a,10a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Example
|*Host* |The host of your OAuth provider's authorization and access token endpoints. For APIs proxied or deployed directly to CloudHub, 0.0.0.0 is mandatory. |`0.0.0.0`
|*Port* |The port of your OAuth provider's authorization and access token endpoints. For APIs proxied or deployed directly to CloudHub, 8081 is mandatory. |`8081`
|*Scopes* |A space-separated list of supported OAuth scopes. |`read write`
|*Authorization Endpoint Path* |The endpoint path to use to authorize an end user. Will be appended to host and port defined above (i.e., 0.0.0.0:8081/authorize). Defaults to `authorize` if no value is provided. |`authorize`
|*Access Token Endpoint Path* |The endpoint path to use for granting the access token. Will be appended to host and port defined above (i.e., 0.0.0.0:8081/access-token). Defaults to `access-token` if no value is provided. |`access-token`
|*Access Token Time-to-Live* |The time in seconds before an access code token expires. |`60`
|*Enable Refresh Token* |True/False. If true, the policy enables the authorization server to issue refresh tokens. |`True`
|*Grant Type(s)* |
Select one or more of the following link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/authorization-grant-types[grant types] to enable them:

* * Implicit
* Client Credentials
* Resource Owner Password Credentials
* Authorization Code |`Authorization Code`
|===

*Note that Scopes and the Client Credentials and Resource Owner Password Credentials grant types are not supported in the embedded console within APIkit at this time. You can apply these to your API, but you will not be able to use the console.

== Configuring an OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy

Configure the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation policy as shown.

[width="99a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Example
|*Scopes* |A space-separated list of supported OAuth scopes. These should match one or more of the scopes defined on the underlying OAuth Provider policy. If no scopes were defined on the provider policy, no scopes are required here. |`read write`
|===

== Unapplying an LDAP Security Manager and OAuth Policies

To unapply the OAuth Provider and Token Enforcement policies backed by a Security Manager from your service version or endpoints, unapply the policies in the reverse order that you added them.

. Unapply the Token Enforcement policy.
. Unapply the OAuth 2.0 Provider policy.
. Unapply the Security Manager policy.

== Obtaining User Credentials

In some cases, you might want to have access to information about what externally authenticated users are using your API. To do so, place the following script in any place between your proxy's inbound and outbound endpoints (it will be executed after the OAuth 2.0 Provider and OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement Policies):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component>
    message.outboundProperties.put('X-Authenticated-userid', _muleEvent.session.securityContext.authentication.principal.username)
</expression-component>
----

The script above stores the username in the mule message as an outbound-property named `X-Authenticated-userid`. The HTTP Connector –used to generate the proxy's output– transforms any outbound properties that reach it into HTTP message headers, so in this way the message that reaches your API after passing through your proxy will include an HTTP header named `X-Authenticated-userid`, containing the username.

[TIP]
====
You can modify this code to change the name of the header being created.
