= Deploy Your API to an API Gateway
:keywords: api, gateway, apikit, deploy

This walkthrough requires an APIkit project or a proxy to deploy to the API Gateway. Complete one of the following tasks:

* Create your own APIkit project.
* Follow the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-tutorial[APIkit Tutorial] to create a project.
* link:_attachments/implementapiwalkthrough.zip[Download a project].
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy[Create a Proxy for your API].

You can apply the lessons you learn in this walkthrough to creating RESTful and SOAP APIs.

You can deploy an API directly to the gateway only if your subscription allows the number of connectors that you use in the API. For more information, contact Support. Click Support on the top navigation bar of the Anypoint Platform.

If you are deploying to an API Gateway that you are hosting on-premises, link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[install and configure] that gateway before proceeding. If you are deploying to a cloud API Gateway, no advanced configuration is required.

You can deploy an API or proxy application to an API Gateway running on your localhost machine. To make your API accessible to other Anypoint Platform users or to the API Console, which accesses your API through a Web proxy, deploy your API on the internet. For example, deploy your API on Cloudhub.

Some capabilities, such as deploying to Cloudhub and creating a proxy might not be available to you, depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes[entitlements you purchased].

== Deploying

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="On-Premises API Gateway"]
....

To perform an on-premises deployment of an APIkit project or proxy application to API Gateway:

. Download your API as a .zip file from the API version page in the API platform.
. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `$MULE_HOME` directory.
+
`<MULE_HOME>` represents the root directory of the installation, typically `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-1.8.0/` on Linux.
+
. Run the startup script:
** Windows: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\gateway`
** Linux: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway`
. Navigate to the directory where the API .zip file is located, remove spaces in the file name if there are any, and copy the file. 
. Drop the copy of the file into the *`<MULE_HOME>/apps`* folder.
+
The API Gateway polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.

----
+
The APIkit project or proxy application is deployed to the API Gateway.
+
The API Gateway detects an existing app update and redeploys the application.

Your app is now synced with the one in your Anypoint Platform account. If you make a change in the API version page, such as applying a policy, the change takes effect momentarily.

To stop the application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. Use `CTRL-C` to stop the Gateway. To update the application at runtime, drop a new .zip version of the app into the `<MULE_HOME>/apps` directory.

=== Starting API Gateway as a Background Process

Instead of running API Gateway in the foreground, you can run it in the background as follows:

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `<MULE_HOME>/bin` directory.
. Run the startup script according to the options below.
** *Windows:* `gateway.bat start`
** *Linux:* `./gateway start`
+
To stop API Gateway, run the script with the `stop` parameter.

[tab,title="Automatically deploy Proxy to CloudHub"]
....

To deploy a proxy to CloudHub automatically, use the same Anypoint Platform account where you registered your API. Your user must have the appropriate permissions both on CloudHub and on the API Platform. If this is not the case, make a manually deploy the proxy to CloudHub as described on the next tab.

Currently, HTTPS proxies can only be deployed to CloudHub manually.

To deploy a proxy to CloudHub automatically:

. In your API Administration page, click *Configure Endpoint* under the API Status section.
. Tick the box labeled *Configure proxy for CloudHub*.
+
image:deploy+ch.png[deploy+ch]
+
. Click the *Save & Deploy* button to deploy your proxy right away. Otherwise, click *Save* to deploy later.
+
The *Deploy proxy* link appears in the *API Status* section.
. Click *Deploy proxy*.
+
The *Deploy proxy* dialog appears.
+
image:deploy+ch+2.png[deploy+ch+2]

. Pick an app name or accept the default, `API`. Choose an environment. Select an API Gateway version or accept the default, which is the latest.
+

+

A link is provided to the actual application on the Runtime Manager for further management, from there you can change the worker type, the environment, set advanced settings, etc. Under the API Status section, a new link appears labeled *Manage CloudHub proxy* that takes you there.


To perform other management tasks, such as changing the worker type, the environment, and setting advanced options, you can click *Manage CloudHub proxy* under the API Status.

[tab,title="Manual Deploy to Cloud API Gateway"]
....

To manually deploy an API to Cloud API Gateway:

. Download your API as a .zip file from the API version page in the API platform.
. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Log in] to your Anypoint Platform account, then go to *Runtime Manager*.
. If necessary, click the current environment name in the top-right corner to switch to another environment.
. Click *Deploy application*.

. In the Deploy Application screen, give your application a unique domain name.
+
The domain name forms part of the URLs that applications use to call your API.
+
. Click *Choose File* and select the .zip file of your proxy application or APIkit project.
. Open the *Properties* section and define two properties with your Anypoint Platform for APIs client ID and client secret.
+
To obtain these credentials, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right, select the *Organization* tab, and click your organization's name.
+
image:CHOrganizationName.png[CHOrganizationName]
+
The Organization info or Business Group info page appears, depending on which part of the organization hierarchy you click. Both screens list the Client ID and Client Secret.
+
*Organization info*:
+
image:OrgClientIDSecret.png[OrgClientIDSecret]
+
*Business Group info:*
+
image:BizGroupInfo.png[BizGroupInfo]
+
. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the page.
+
. In the Properties section of the Deploy Application page, replace the placeholders with the numbers for your organization's *client_id* and **client_secret**.
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
anypoint.platform.client_id=00000000000000
anypoint.platform.client_secret=00000000000000
----
. Click *Create*.

. The Runtime Manager automatically moves to the *Logs* view where you can track the status of the deployment. Watch for this message:
+

The application is deployed to the API Gateway.

To stop the application, go to the *Deployment* tab and click *Stop Application*. To update the application at runtime, upload a new .zip file on the Deployment tab, and click *Update*. The API Gateway performs a zero downtime update using the new application file.

....
------
If you add or edit policies on your proxy, there's no need to redeploy the app, as the changes apply automatically within a few seconds.
