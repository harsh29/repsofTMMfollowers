= Deploying Your API or Proxy
:keywords: api, proxy, gateway, apikit, deploy

This walkthrough describes how to deploy an APIkit project or an API proxy to an API Gateway or other runtime. This walkthrough uses features that might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on the link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes[entitlements you purchased].

The features for creating an proxy and deploying to CloudHub might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes[entitlements you purchased].

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have done one of the following things:

* Built a new API using link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/building-your-api[APIkit ]
 _or_

* Created an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[auto-generated proxy application] for the endpoint on which your API is hosted (if you want to deploy on premises or manually on the Runtime Manager, you must downloaded it as a .zip file)
 _or_
* Built a link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[custom proxy application] for the endpoint on which your API is hosted

To deploy your application to a Mule runtime or an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[API Gateway], determine whether you should deploy to a runtime or a gateway, and link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/deploying-your-api-or-proxy#selecting-a-deployment-target[select a deployment target].

If you are deploying to a Mule on-premises runtime, follow link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[the instructions] to download and install the runtime before proceeding.

If you are deploying to an API Gateway that you are hosting on-premises, follow the instructions to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[install and configure] that gateway before proceeding. If you are deploying to a cloud API Gateway, no configuration is required in advance.

If your API is behind a firewall, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Accessing Your API Behind a Firewall].

== Selecting a Deployment Target

Before you proceed, determine what you have and where you are trying to deploy it.

[width="99a",cols="50a,50a",options="header"]
|===
|If you... |Then deploy to...
|Downloaded a proxy application from the API Version Details page for your API |An API Gateway
|Built your own proxy following the instructions |An API Gateway
|Built an API using APIkit, and your API includes _only_ HTTP/S, Jetty, and/or Web Service Consumer connectors and/or a maximum of two additional connectors |An API Gateway
|Built an API using APIkit, and your API includes one or more connectors _other than_ HTTP/S, Jetty, and/or Web Service Consumer and the allotted two additional connectors |A Mule runtime
|===

Both API Gateway and Mule runtimes have on-premises and cloud versions. Follow the instructions below for your deployment target.

== Deploying

This section gives detailed instructions for deploying Mule applications (whether they are APIkit projects or Mule applications acting as proxies for existing APIs) to your API Gateway instances or Mule runtimes.

Your APIkit project or proxy application should be saved as a deployable zip file. If you created or modified the file in Anypoint Studio:

. Save it and then go to *File* > *Export...*
. Select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, and click *Next*.
. Select the name of your application from the *Project* drop-down, and click *Browse...* to select a destination for your application file. Click *Finish* .

If your organization has On Premises Auto-Deploy enabled, and you have already configured your API Gateway for Auto-deployment, then you can also deploy your applications on premises link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[via the Anypoint Runtime Manager Console].


=== Deploying to API Gateway

[tabs]

[tab,title="On-Prem API Gateway"]
....

If it is not already running, start your API Gateway in the command line by running:

* *Windows:* `<MULE_HOME>\bin\gateway`
* *Unix:* `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway`

*Starting the API Gateway as a Background Process*

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `<MULE_HOME>/bin` directory.
. Run the startup script with the start option.
+
* *Unix*: `./gateway start`
* *Windows:* `gateway.bat start`
+
To stop the gateway, run the script with the `stop` parameter.
+
. Navigate to the directory where the .zip file is located and copy the .zip file. Ensure that your copy of the file does not have any spaces in the name. 
. Drop the copy of the .zip file into the *`<MULE_HOME>/apps`* folder.
+
*`<MULE_HOME>`* is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by MuleSoft's *API Gateway*, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-2.2.0/`.
+
The API Gateway polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.
+
. Congratulations! Your APIkit project or proxy application is deployed to your API Gateway.

Next, return to your API Version Details page. If you deployed your application to a correctly configured API Gateway and set your API URL in the Version Details page to match the inbound endpoint in your application, the Anypoint Platform agent should track your endpoint, and the indicator light should turn green. Read more about link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[Setting Your API URL].

If you wish to undeploy your application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. This removes your application from the `/app` directory, which automatically undeploys it from the API Gateway.

If you wish to update your application at runtime, you can drop a new .zip version of the app into the `<MULE_HOME>/apps` directory. The API Gateway detects this as an existing app update and ensure a clean redeployment of the application.

[NOTE]
This procedure works with API Gateway 2.0 and above.


. Register your server in the Runtime Manager. To register your server, see the simplified instructions below, or the full instructions in link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[Managing Servers].

. In Anypoint Platform, go to *Runtime Manager*.
+
[NOTE]
If using the Anypoint Platform on premises, this section is named *Applications*.

. Click the *Servers* tab, then *Add Servers*.
. The Add Servers screen displays a command which includes _*token*_ specifically generated for your gateway. Copy this token to your clipboard.
. In the server where your gateway resides, open a terminal and go to the gateway's `bin` directory.
. Run the following command:


[source, code, linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H <token> <server name>
----
+
`<token>` is the token displayed in the Add Servers screen, and `<server name>` is the name you select for your server. This should register your server with the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager console].

. Start the gateway if it's not started already

* *Windows*: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\gateway.bat`
* *Unix/Linux*: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway`
+
These commands start the gateway as a foreground process. To start the gateway in the background, issue the `start` parameter, for example `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway start`.

. In Anypoint Platform, click *APIs* to go to the API management page.
. Click *Add new API*.
. Anypoint Platform displays the information page for the API, shown below. Under API Status, click *Configure endpoint*.
+
image:conf_api.png[conf_api]
+
. In the endpoint configuration screen shown below, fill in the required information for the API you would like to manage.
+
image:conf_endpoint_props.png[conf_endpoint_props]
+
. Click **Save & deploy**. You see the status of your gateway is running.
+
image:deploy_proxy.png[deploy_proxy]
+
If you don't see your gateway, its server was not properly registered. In this case, you see a screen like the one shown below.
+
image:no_server.png[no_server]
+
The screen gives you the option to add a new API Gateway.
+
. Select your gateway, then click *Deploy proxy*.
+
image:deploying.png[deploying]
+
. After deployment is complete, the API status symbol turns green, for active. At this point, you have successfully auto-deployed your API.

For more information about registering a server, see *Add a Server* section of link:/cloudhub/managing-applications-and-servers-in-the-cloud-and-on-premises[Managing Applications and Domains in the Cloud and On-Premises].

....
[tab,title="Cloud API Gateway - Automatic"]
....

To deploy to CloudHub using this method, use the Anypoint Platform account where your API is registered. Your user account must have the appropriate permissions both on CloudHub and on the API Platform. If this is not the case, see the next tab *CloudHub API Gateway - Manual*.

Currently, HTTPS proxies can only be deployed to CloudHub manually.

. In your API Administration page, click *Configure Endpoint* under the API Status section.
. Tick the box labeled *Configure proxy for CloudHub*.
+
image:deploy+ch.png[deploy+ch]
+
When ticking the box, the *Port* field changes.
+
. Click *Save & Deploy* to deploy your proxy right away. Otherwise, click *Save* and deploy later.
After configuring the proxy for CloudHub, a new link labeled *Deploy proxy* appears in the *API Status* section. Use it to open the deploy menu.
+
image:deploy+ch+2.png[deploy+ch+2]

. In the deploy menu, pick an app name, environment, and API Gateway version, or accept the defaults.
+
[NOTE]
A link is then be provided to the actual application on the Runtime Manager for further management, from there you can then change the worker type, the environment, set advanced settings, etc. Under the API Status section, a new link will appear labeled *Manage CloduHub proxy* that takes you there.
+
. The status of the API deployment is indicated by the marker in the API Status section of the API version page. While the app is starting, you will see a spinner. Once it starts successfully, the light will turn green.

After the app starts, a new link under the API Status labeled **Re-deploy proxy** appears. If you make changes to the endpoint configuration you can click this link to re-deploy your proxy application to the same CloudHub application.

. Ensure that you are in the correct environment for deployment. If necessary, click your username, then click *Switch environment* . 
. Click *Add application*.
+
image:add+cloudhub+app.jpeg[add+cloudhub+app]
+
. In the Add Application screen, give your application a unique domain name.
+
The domain name forms part of the URLs that applications should use to call your API, so it should represent your API itself.
+
. Click *Choose file* and select the .zip file of your proxy application or APIkit project.
. Open the *Properties* section and define the following *Environment Variables*.  
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
anypoint.platform.client_id="[your organization's unique client_id]"
anypoint.platform.client_secret="[your organization's unique client secret]"
----
+
Use your Anypoint Platform for APIs client id and client secret, which you can obtain from an Organization Administrator. Log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right, and then select the *Organization* tab. The client id and secret id appear.
+
. Make sure that when deploying your application, you pick a compatible runtime in the the *Mule Version* field. See Release notes.
. Click *Create*.

. The Runtime Manager automatically moves to the *Logs* view where you can track the status of the deployment. Watch for this message:
+
image:proxyCH-started.png[image]
+
. Congratulations! Your application is deployed to your API Gateway.

Next, return to your API Version Details page. If you deployed your application with a valid client id and client secret for your Anypoint Platform organization and set your API URL in the Version Details page to match the inbound endpoint in your application's XML configuration, the Anypoint Platform agent should track your endpoint, and the indicator light should turn green. Read more about link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[Setting Your API URL].

If you wish to undeploy your application, go to the *Deployment* tab and click *Stop Application*.

If you wish to update your application at runtime, you can upload a new .zip file on the Deployment tab and click *Update*. The API Gateway will perform a zero downtime update using the new application file.

[TIP]
If you plan to expose your API through SSL, then there are a couple of link:/runtime-manager/building-an-https-service[additional steps] you need to take.

If it is not already running, start Mule in the command line by running:

* *Windows*: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\mule`
* *Unix*: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/mule`

*Starting Mule as a Foreground Process*

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory.
. Run the startup script according to the options below.

* *Unix:* `./mule`
* *Windows:* `mule`

To stop Mule, press `CTRL-C` in the terminal in which the script is running.

*Starting Mule as a Background Process*

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `<MULE_HOME>/bin` directory.

+
* *Unix:* `./mule start`
* *Windows:* `mule.bat start`
+
To stop Mule, run the script with the `stop` parameter.
+
. Navigate to the directory where the proxy .zip file is located and copy the .zip file. Ensure that your copy of the file does not have any spaces in the name. 
. Drop the copy of the .zip file into the *`<MULE_HOME>/apps`* folder.
+*`<MULE_HOME`>* is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by Mule ESB, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/mule-standalone-3.6.0/`.
. Mule polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.
+
image:deploy_proxy.png[image]

Congratulations! Your API is deployed to the Mule runtime.

If you wish to undeploy your application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. This removes your application from the `/app` directory, which automatically undeploys it.

If you wish to update your API at runtime, you can drop a new .zip version of the app into the `$MULE_HOME/apps` directory. Mule will detect this as an existing app update and will ensure a clean redeployment of the application.
