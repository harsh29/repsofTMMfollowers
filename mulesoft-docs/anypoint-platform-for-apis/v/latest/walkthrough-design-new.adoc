= Design a New API
:keywords: raml, api, designer

In this walkthrough, you create an API by writing a RAML file. You use the API Designer as your RAML editor. 

This walkthrough requires API Creator permissions. 

== About RAML

link:http://raml.org/[RAML] (RESTful API Modeling Language) is a simple and practical language for describing APIs. RAML encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open specification.

For more information, see:

* link:http://raml.org/developers/document-your-api[Documentation] and
link:http://raml.org/developers/raml-100-tutorial[Tutorials]
* link:http://raml.org/projects/projects[RAML Projects]

RAML makes it easier for you to write your API, and provides a series of online tools that make it easier for developers to engage with your API.

A RAML file includes the following elements:

* Root
* Documentation
* Resources
* Methods
* Pattern-based, reusable elements

[TIP]
One of the key strengths of the RAML specification is the ability to reuse elements, which makes your API more succinct and more readable. However, the reusable elements in RAML are outside the scope of this walkthrough; for more information, visit the link:http://raml.org/docs.html[RAML tutorials].

== The API Designer

While you _may_ write your RAML file in any text editor, we recommend you check out the API Designer. Using the web-based API Designer, you can design an API quickly, efficiently, and consistently. API Designer consists of a RAML editor with an embedded RAML API console that proactively provides suggestions, error feedback, and a built-in, live testing environment.

A context-aware shelf at the bottom of the Designer displays a list of the components you can enter at that point in the hierarchy of your RAML. The components are arranged into categories that appear when relevant: Root, Docs, Parameters, Security, Resources, Methods, Traits and Types, Schemas, Body, and Responses.

== Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes that you followed steps in link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-intro-create[Create an API] to log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] and create an API version details page for the T-Shirt Service API.

== Starting

You are now ready to start the walkthrough by opening your project in the API Designer.

. Click the version number of your project. For example, 1.0.development.
+
image:ap-click-vnum.png[Click the version number for more details]
+
. Click *Edit in API designer*:

== Design a New API in RAML

In this section, you design a RESTful, RAML-based API from scratch that creates a web service for users to order t-shirts and track orders. This API consists of a series of operations that users of your API can call.

Each operation maps to a resource. All the operations in this API relate to one of the following resources:

** `/products` (mostly t-shirts)
** `/orders` (t-shirt orders, of course)
** orders each have a nested `{orderId}/status`, which is considered a sub-resource of `orders`.

You can type these resources into the RAML definition, or click components in API Designer to build the RAML definition. If you click to enter a component, it disappears from the shelf if it's no longer available for entry. For example, if you select a `GET` method from the list of Methods, it disappears from the Shelf because you cannot have two `GET` methods on the same resource.

To design a new API in RAML:

. In the new RAML file, notice that the information you provided when registering the new API (the name and version number) appears in the root.
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
----
+
. On the next line, add a placeholder for a `baseUri`. Specify `baseUri` as: `http://www.tshirt.com/api`
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
----
+
This placeholder helps you test the API and visualize what your final URL will look like with resources appended to it.
+
. Go to the next line, and if necessary, click image:shelf-icon.png[shelf-icon] to expand the shelf. If you don't see the shelf icon, refresh the page.
. Click the `New Resource` component on the shelf.
+
This action adds lines of skeleton code at your cursor position. 
+
image:new+resource.png[new+resource]
+
. Go to the next line and click New Resource a second time.
. Go to the next line and click New Resource a third time.
. Replace the text in the resource title and in its child elements' `displayName` as follows:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
/products:
  displayName: Products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
----
. Align the text as shown here.
+
[WARNING]
Elements that API Designer suggests in the shelf depend contextually upon where you place the cursor: the shelf allows placement only of elements that make sense in that particular position within the RAML tree structure.
+
Here's what your RAML should look like so far:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
/products:
  displayName: Products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
----
+
The API Console, displayed to the right of the editor, now contains information for Developers who want to know what resources are available on your API and how to access them.
+
image:basic+console.png[basic+console]
. To the `products` resource, add a `GET` method: Go to the line below `displayName:Products`, and click GET on the shelf.
+
image:methods.png[methods]
+
Users of the API will be able to read information about products, but not post new products.
+
. To the `/orders` resource, add a `POST` method.
+
Users will be able to place orders.
. To the `status` resource, add a `GET` method.
+
Users will be able to check an order's status.
+
. Add valid descriptions for each of the methods you add.
+
*Note*: You can copy and paste from this document to the API Designer to save time.
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
/products:
  displayName: Products
  get:
    description: Get a list of all the inventory products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  post:
    description: Place a new T-Shirt order
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
    get:
      description: Get the status of an existing order
----
+
In the API Console on the right, the resources have a corresponding method.
+
. Click each method to read the descriptions you just added.
+
image:api-designer-resources.png[api-designer-resources]
+
. Use the `responses` component on the shelf to specify which `responses` will be valid for each of these methods:
+
* `200` (OK) response for all methods
* `500` (server error) response for the `POST order` method in case something fails on the server side
* `400` (client error) response for the `GET status` resource in case the user requests a nonexistent order
+
In the case of this API, the service behind the API constructs the actual response that a user receives.  Nevertheless, it's a good practice to provide a response example in the API RAML. With these examples in place, developers can then use the API Console to preview the structure of the response and build their consuming application accordingly.

. To ensure that `POST` requests sent to the *`/order`* resource are valid, you can enforce that they all follow a given structure. You can provide a schema to match for incoming requests to ensure their validity. To help developers that are trying to understand what input your API requires, you can also add an example message, which is not only readable in the RAML code, but that is visible if the API is looked at in the API Console. Add both these elements into the `post` method of the `/orders` resource, placing them within `body – application/json`.

. At the same level on the tree structure as the operation's `response` label, add a *queryParameters* element to the `GET` operation with the following attributes:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
queryParameters:
        email:
          description: Retrieve the status of an order with the same email that was used to place the order.
          pattern: ^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$
          required: true
----
+
This step makes it possible to query the `status` resource using the requester's email.

== Testing your RAML API in the Console

To test a user's experience, call the API in the API console. 

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the Mocking Service.
+
image:mocking+service.png[mocking+service]
+
Previously the `baseUri` was a placeholder for the duration of the design phase. The service isn't actually tied to anything at the moment: calling http://www.tshirt.com/api doesn't return a response. The Mocking Service provides the following response:
+
image:mock+URL.png[mock+URL]
+
The `baseUri` that you provided when declaring your basic information at the root has been commented out and replaced by a new URI. You've effectively published your API and it is now ready to receive live calls. You've also provided example responses. You can make live calls in the API Console or your browser, and the API returns data that you've provided in your RAML API definition. You can see what your API consumers see when they make calls to the API, and fully test APX. 
+
Test that theory in the API console by making a `GET` request on the status of a particular order.
+
image:Screenshot+2014-07-03+14.49.46.png[Screenshot+2014-07-03+14.49.46]
+
As shown here, by providing a valid email address, the request URL reflects the resource path appended to the `baseUri` just as it would with any functioning API. The call was performed live, and in response the user received a status 200: success! The response body is the example provided in the RAML file. In this case, the information isn't important – it's knowing how the response looks and that it's successful that's important.
