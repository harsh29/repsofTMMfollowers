= Analytics Event API
:keywords: analytics, api, reports

The Anypoint Platform for APIs gathers powerful analytics data for each API that is managed using the platform. This data is displayed visually in your API's dashboard, but many scenarios require access to the raw data so that it can be analyzed or transformed. To meet this need, the Analytics Reporting API makes it easy to create a report that queries the desired data and exposes it via an API endpoint. You can also create reports that span more than one API, or create different reports for the same API.

== Creating a Report

The following steps show you how to create a report.

. As an Organization Administrator, you have access to the Analytics Dashboards for your organization. Go to *http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics[http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics]* to access your Analytics Dashboards. You can also click *Analytics* in the drop-down menu in the top-right of the window.

+
. On the top menu, click *Manage Reports*.
. On the *Manage Reports* page, click *New* to create a new report.
. On the *Create Report* page, select your desired data source, range, format, and fields. A URL generates for the configured report, which represents the endpoint that can be called.

+
. Click *Save Report* to save the report and make it available at the specified endpoint. You are redirected to the *Manage Reports* page.

== Running a Report in the Browser

The following steps show you how to run a report from the *Manage Reports* page in the dashboard.

. On the *Manage Reports* page, click *Run* for the specified report. +

+
. After the report has finished running, the resulting file is saved in the data format that was selected when the report was created. For example, `ShippingAPI Usage.csv`. This file contains all of the raw analytics data for the parameters you specified in the report.

== Calling a Report Programmatically

The following steps show you how to call the report's API endpoint and programmatically retrieve the analytics data.

NOTE: These instructions use `curl` for OS X or Linux. If you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell to accomplish the same tasks.

. Open a new terminal window and execute the following command:
+
[source]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=<YOUR-USERNAME>&password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>")
----
+
. This command sends a request to the authentication servers of the Anypoint Platform and, if the request is successful, returns an access token that's stored in the `$TOKEN` variable. The value of this variable is displayed below:
+
[source, json,linenums]
----
{
 "access_token": "fbd78478-8523-4936-aa81-a2fb7e705538",
 "token_type": "bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
 }
----
+
. Once the access token has been received, it must be appended to the `Authorization` header in the request to the Analytics Reporting API endpoint for your report. To make a request to this endpoint, copy it from the *Manage Reports* page in the Analytics dashboard. Using the `$TOKEN` variable from the previous step, include it in the next request as shown below:
+
[source]
----
curl -H "Authorization: bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/47f40446-9f0b-43c0-a8ca-c7aea5136f32/events?format=csv&apiIds=2447&startDate=2014-12-02&endDate=2015-01-08&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path > output.csv"
----
+
. If the request is successful, the response includes a CSV file (as requested) that downloads as a file with the specified name (`output.csv)` in the directory where the `curl` request was made.

== Data Fields for Reports

Your report can query data for one, many, or all of the available data fields. These fields are explained in the table below.
