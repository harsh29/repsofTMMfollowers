= Engaging Users of Your API
:keywords: api, portal, console, notebook, raml

This page covers how to create and manage an API Portal for your API version, including how to customize your content, configure privacy, and add an API Console and API Notebook to your portal.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you have API Version Owner permissions for the API version for which you are trying to create a portal. 

== Creating a Basic API Portal

From the API Version Details page, select *Create new Portal* on the dropdown menu under *API Portal*.

The Anypoint Platform prompts you to create a new API Portal or attach your API version to an existing portal to reuse its content. Note that when you reuse an existing API Portal, the portal has a unique URL specific to your API version and displays API-version-specific content for the API Console and API Notebook. 

Connecting your current API version to a pre-existing API Portal ensures consistency across various iterations of your documentation. If the latest version of your API makes only slight changes to the API contract, then perhaps the majority of your documentation does not actually need to change. When that is the case, it is far simpler to attach your current API version to pre-existing content. 

For more information see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-api-versions[Linking Multiple Versions of an API to a Shared API Portal].

== Customizing The Look of Your API Portal

If you create a new API Portal, it will start out as a bare-bones page that barely includes a minimalist home page. Keep in mind that the entire portal will be private until you choose to make the content in it visible and switch the portal to *public*.

There are three kinds of elements you can add to build up the content of your portal:

* <<Adding Pages>>: Write plain markdown text, ideal for describing what your API does in broad terms, or to communicate any other information your users may find useful.
* API Reference: If your API has a RAML definition attached to it in its API Version Details page, you can add an automatically generated interactive console that not only lists and describes the possible calls your API supports, it can even be used by your users to perform live calls to it.
* <<Adding an API Notebook>>: A versatile interactive tool, ideal for writing tutorials about how to use your API or even about how to integrate it with other services

To add any of these to your portal, click the Add button on the left and select the type of element you want to add.

Through this same button you can also add:

* Headers, which are displayed on the portal's left nav bar, separating your various sections of content
* External Links, which are also displayed in the portal's left nav bar, and can lead to any external link you choose

[NOTE]

Notice that after creating and saving any of these elements, you still need to set them to visible before they can be seen by your users in your portal.

== Adding Pages

When you first create your API Portal, it will already include a single Page element named *Home*, this is the landing page for your API Version. Use this space to provide your users with the information necessary to onboard them to your API quickly and easily. Introduce your users to what your API can do!

Add more pages to your portal to communicate any other information that you think your users may find helpful. Do this by clicking the *Add* button and selecting *Page*.

image:add+page.png[add+page]

To add content to a page, select it and click the *Edit* button, the editor accepts link:https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown[GitHub Flavored Markdown] coding. *Save* your page by clicking the button on the top right of the editor, and click *Preview* whenever you want to take a look at how the finished product is shaping up.

Once you're done writing the content for a page, on the left menu mark the tick box next to it and click then click the eye icon to make it visible. Keep in mind that the page will be invisible until you do, even if your portal is set to being public.

== Adding an API Console

During the process of developing your API Portal, you have the opportunity to define your API in RAML. For more information on RAML and the API Designer, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/designing-your-api[Designing Your API].

image:2.jpeg[2]

If you already supplied a RAML API definition before you created your API Portal, you can include an API Console to your API Portal in a page called *API reference*. Remember that the API Console is your API's interactive documentation. It is a UI that allows users to place single calls to your API for testing and to see the expected response. The Console that appears in your API Portal is identical to the one adjacent to the API Designer, so that you can see what your users will experience as you design your API.

You can build upon the content of your API Console by fleshing out your RAML definition. For example you can include sample requests and responses for each possible call to your API, these will be displayed in your API Console on each corresponding action + resource pair.

To add this page to your API portal, click the *Add* button and select *API Reference*. When you're ready to make the page visible, mark the tick box next to it and click the eye icon. Keep in mind that the page will be invisible until you do, even if your portal is set to being public.

== Adding an API Notebook

Adding an API Notebook to your Portal is as simple as adding a Console. Click the *Add* button and select *API Notebook*.This adds a new page to your portal's left navigation bar. Click the *Edit* button to start writing the content of the API Notebook, then *Save* when you're done, and *Preview* whenever you want to take a look at how the finished product is shaping up.

image:notebook.png[notebook]

When you're ready to make the API Notebook visible, mark the tick box next to it and click the eye icon. Keep in mind that the page will be invisible until you do, even if your portal is set to being public.

To rename the API Notebook page in your navigation, simply select the black bar and enter your new title.

Recall that the API Notebook is essentially a JavaScript client-generator that allows you to easily invoke one or more APIs with chained calls to demonstrate various use cases. This makes it extremely valuable for your API users, so add as many Notebooks to your API portal as you like. For more information about the API Notebook, see further documentation and examples at link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook.]

== Making Your API Portal Public vs Private

All API Portals are either *Public* or *Private*.

* *Public* API Portals can be viewed by anyone, regardless of whether they are a member of your Anypoint Platform organization, whether they are signed in, or what permissions they have.
* *Private* API Portals can only be viewed by logged-in users of your Anypoint Platform organization who have Portal Viewer permissions for that API version. Note that unless you created the API version yourself, you must be explicitly granted Portal Viewer permissions. Note that you also inherit Portal Viewer permissions if you are granted Portal Editor permissions for an API version. Read more about link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform[permissions].

When you first create a new portal, it is Private by default. Click the Private/Public icon on the top right of the editor to toggle the state of your portal between public and private.:

image:private.png[private]

When clicked, the icon changes its image and color, and reads *Public*.

Note that as soon as you make your portal Public, it appears on your Developer Portal to everyone, including anonymous users. Anyone will be able to discover your API and access its API Portal and see any documentation that you have published there.

== Skinning Your API Portal

You can adjust the look and feel of your API Portal by clicking the Themes icon on the top right of the editor.

image:themes.png[themes]

Clicking *API Portal Theme Settings* opens the API Portal Theme Settings interface, as shown.

image:skin.png[skin]

Here you can add your own logo and pick the colors for the different elements in your portal's top nav bar, either from a palette or by typing the precise Hex color codes you prefer. The changes you make on this window are reflected only for your API Portal.

=== Setting up a Universal Skin for All your API Portals

If you have multiple API Portals, you can set up a universal theme that will be applied to every API Portal in your organization and its business group. To access the menu where you can set this up, go to the API Administration page, click the icon on the top-right of the screen and select *Developer portal theme settings*.

[TIP]

If you apply these settings at the Master Organization level, this theme will be used in the API Portals of every one of your business groups. If you apply this within the API Administration page of an individual business group, the theme you set up will override the theme defined at a higher level and affect only the API Portals of that business group.

=== Previewing Your Portal

While still developing your portal, you can click the icon labeled *Live Portal* on the top right of the editor to preview how your portal looks so far.

== Deleting Elements

To delete any element from your portal, be it a markup page, an API Notebook or the API Reference, simply select the checkbox for the element on the left menu, then click the trashcan icon. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to delete this element.
