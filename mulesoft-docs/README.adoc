== MuleSoft Docs Style Guide

The following sections describe the MuleSoft Docs publishing style.

=== Content

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Style |Correct Example |Incorrect Example
|Use active text instead of "will", "you'll", "won't", or "we'll". |This feature initializes and merges your code. |This feature will initialize and merge your code.
|Obfuscate login credentials in illustrations and code |The client secret is 4242424242424242-ABADDOG |My password is foobar123
|Only use RFC-1918 IP addresses for example IPv4 addresses: +
10.0.0.0  - 10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix) +
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix) +
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
|Set the server address to 10.1.1.42 |For example, set the address to 42.42.42.42.
|Use the example.com domain |For example, mydomain@example.com |myname@mycompany.com
|Omit "please" |Contact MuleSoft Customer Support. |Please contact MuleSoft Customer Support.
|Separate options with > and don't cast the > in bold |*File* > *New* > *Mule Project* | *File -> New -> Mule Project*
|Replace "in order to" with "to" |To start the procedure, |In order to start the procedure
|Omit "then" |Click this and that |Click this, and then click that
|Don't use "select" if you mean click. Select only highlights text. Click activates a link or button. |Click *OK*. |Select *OK*.
|Omit button ellipses |Click *Test Connections*. |Click *Test Connections...*.
|Omit "on" with click |Click *Test Connections*. |Click on *Test Connections*.
|Init-cap words in headings |Default Value Setting |Default value setting
|Spell out i.e. and e.g. |Create a connector, for example, for Salesforce |Create a connector, e.g. for Salesforce
|Don't put code examples in a screenshot |Put code in a source block |screenshot
|Put a period outside a quote string |Don't say "will". |Don't say "will."
|Use the Oxford comma |a, b, and c |a, b and c
|Omit the trademark symbol |Anypoint Platform |Anypoint™ Platform™
|===

=== AsciiDoc Conventions

* `[source]` is better than `[source,code]`.
* Better to use "a" columns in tables such as cols="30a,70a".
* Omit `linenums` option on 1 line code examples.
* Put multi-word examples in a source block instead of a long tick marked string.
* Tab names should be "Visual Studio Editor" and "XML Editor or Standalone".
* Only XML or XML procedures can be in an XML tab. It's illogical to put a screenshot in the XML tab.
* Restrict tables to 2 or 3 columns - multi-column tables can be very difficult to read.
* Wrap code example lines at spaces, or for Java after a dot. Code lines should be less than 60 characters, especially if you use the \//<n> notation for callouts
* Until Coderay fixes the spacing for line numbers, don't reference code examples by line numbers. Instead usee \//<1> in the code example and reference the notation in the text below the code example.

=== Lists

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Rule |Description |Example
|Imperative before lists |Before starting a list, provide a starting sentence that starts with "to" 
that describes the task you want people to provide. Also, don't start a bullet or numbered list after a heading without a starting sentence. |To set the values:
|Insert a period at the end of a sentence or bullet list item |Perform these tasks. |Perform these tasks
|Start each item in a bullet list or numbered list with a capital letter |Start list items that are not reserved words with an init cap
|* Ensure all required fields are set.
|Start number list items with an action |Number list items only start with an action such as Click, Set, etc. |1. Click the plus
sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*.

=== Font Changes

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Font |Description |Example
|Bold |A button or field name |Click *Test Connections*.
|`tick marks` |Reserved words or code examples, such as a MEL expression |`#[payload]`
|Italics |Emphasis |_Ensure the checkbox is set_
|Bold italics |Mule Enterprise license requirements. |*_Enterprise_*
|Bold links |Important links like Skip to Code | \*\<\<Skip to Code>>*
|Quotes |Displayed items
|===

=== Headings

* No special characters in headings
* Init-cap each word in a heading
* Don't put a colon at the end of a heading
* Ensure headings are in order, h1 > h2 > h3 > h4. Don't skip levels such as h2 > h5
* Only one H1 per doc at the top of the file
* Don't number headings

=== Word Choices

* JSON not Json
* POJO not pojo or Pojo
* MOJO not mojo or Mojo
* ID not id or Id
* Anypoint Studio not Mule Studio

Don't spell out common acronyms such as POJO, JSON, MOJO, REST, SOAP, MQ, UI, IT, IP, TCP/IP
