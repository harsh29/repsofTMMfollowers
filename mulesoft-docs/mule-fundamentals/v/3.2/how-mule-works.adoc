MuleSoft has released Studio GA, a powerful new interface for Mule ESB that can cut your development time by half or more. You can model, debug, and deploy your applications all within the rich, yet flexible Studio environment.

Studio provides two-way (i.e., graphical and code-based) editing, which means that developers no longer have to trade ease-of-use against fine-grained control over their development projects. Any changes you make in one mode appear instantly in the other.

Mule Enterprise and Mule iON developers can fine-tune their applications in the advanced Studio XML editor, then re-deploy them on whichever version of Mule those applications were originally developed.

Studio installation is almost instantaneous, and a pair of tutorials can get you up and running in less than 40 minutes.

Letâ€™s get Kicking!

= How Mule Works

When you examine how a message flows through Mule ESB, you can see that there are three layers in the architecture: the application layer, the integration layer, and the transport layer.

Likewise, there are three general types of tasks you can perform to configure and customize your Mule deployment:

* Service Component Development: developing or reuse existing POJOs, services, Cloud Connectors, or Spring beans that contain the business logic and will consume, process, or enrich messages.
* Service Orchestration: configuring message processors, routers, transformers, and filters that provide the service mediation and orchestration capabilities required to allow composition of loosely coupled services using a Mule Flow. New orchestration elements can also be created and dropped into your deployment.
* Integration: A key requirement of service mediation is decoupling services from the underlying protocols. Mule provides transports to allow dispatching and receiving messages on different protocol connectors. These connectors are configured in the Mule configuration and then can be referenced from the orchestration layer. Mule supports many existing transports and all the popular communication protocols, but you may also develop a custom transport if you need to extend Mule to support a particular legacy or proprietary system.

This page provides a high-level overview of the steps you take to perform these tasks.

== Create a Service Component

A service component is a class, web service, or other application that contains the business logic you want to plug in to the Mule service bus. You can use any existing Java class, Spring bean, Groovy script, a Cloud Connector, or http://www.mulesoft.org/display/MULE3USER/Developing%20Components[create a new component]. Your service component does not need to contain any Mule-specific code. All the Mule-specific instructions will be configured on the service that wraps the service component.

To assist development, you can use the #[Mule IDE]#, which works within Eclipse to provide an integrated development environment for developing Mule applications.

== Configure the Mule Instance

The Mule configuration file allows you to configure all the elements you need in your Mule instance. You use the `<configuration>` element to set global configuration options such as the threading profile. You then define the connectors, transformers, and endpoints you'll use in different flows. Lastly, you configure flows or service models, which act as containers for services and orchestration elements and apply settings such as the queue profile and error handling to all the services in that flow or service model. For complete information, see #[About Mule Configuration]#.

== Configure the Flow

You configure a flow using the `<flow>` element in the Mule configuration file. The flow creates a composition around the service component(s) that allows you to define how messaged are routed, filtered, transformed and enriched before or after processing by one or a series of service components. Flows are more flexible and robust than the traditional service model in Mule, allowing a more natural and compact means of describing service orchestration. For more information, see #[Using Flows for Service Orchestration]#.

Mule provides an even more compact notation for commonly used patterns called #[Configuration Patterns]#.

== Configure the Service

You may also configure a service within a `<model>` element in the Mule configuration file. The service points to the service component, routers, filters, and transformers. It also specifies the endpoint on which this service will receive messages and the outbound endpoint where messages will go next. For more information, see http://www.mulesoft.org/display/MULE3USER/Configuring+the+Service[Configuring the Service].

Following is more information on configuring message processors, routers, filters, and transformers for the service.

=== Message Processors

Message Processors are the basic #[building blocks]# in Mule and in fact, components, routers, filters, and transformers are all message processors. There are also other special message processors that do not fall in one of those categories. These include a number of specialized modules like CXF and Jersey Web Services, BPM, as well as a few specialized integration elements like `<poll>`, `<content-enricher>`, and `<logger>`. You can also easily create your own #[custom message processor]#.

=== Routers

Inbound routers specify how messages are routed to a service, and outbound routers specify how messages are routed after the service has finished processing them. There are several default routers that come with Mule that you can use, or you can create your own routers. For more information, see http://www.mulesoft.org/display/MULE3USER/Using+Message+Routers[Using Message Routers].

=== Filters

Filters specify conditions that must be met for a message to be routed to a service. There are several default filters that come with Mule that you can use, or you can create your own filters. For more information, see http://www.mulesoft.org/display/MULE3USER/Using+Filters[Using Filters].

=== Transformers

Transformers convert incoming payload data to the type required by the service component. After the service has finished processing the message, they can also convert the message to a different type as needed by the outbound transport. There are several default transformers you can use, or create your own. For more information, see http://www.mulesoft.org/display/MULE3USER/Using+Transformers[Using Transformers].

== Transports and Connectors

Mule provides #[default transports]# for many different channels, including File, FTP, HTTP, JMS, JDBC, Quartz, and many more. Transports communicate with the channel using a connector. There are also many community-contributed transports and Cloud Connectors on http://muleforge.org/[MuleForge].

=== Cloud Connectors

Cloud Connectors are actually message processors that are used to speak to application APIs over existing transports - almost always HTTP. Cloud Connectors typically connect SaaS applications, social media, cloud infrastructure services, and cloud-based data services.

== Extend Mule

Mule provides a complete set of APIs for extending Mule. Typical custom extensions include:

* Cloud Connectors
* Transports
* Custom Message Processors
* Custom Transformers
* Configuration Patterns

If you develop an extension to Mule that you think others might reuse or help support or improve, you could decide to share it on http://muleforge.org/[MuleForge].

In addition to the Mule IDE, you can also use Maven to create new Mule projects (transports and other types of modules). For more information, see #[Using Maven]#.
