. Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app for a Mac, Command Prompt for Windows), run: `java -version`
+
The response should appear similar to the following:
+
[source, code, linenums]

. If the wrong version of Java is present on your computer, the following may occur after you start Studio:
.. *Mac*: The command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7. See: Running Studio on a Mac?
.. *Windows*: This message appears when you start Studio:
Incompatible JVM - Version _<number>_ of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version 1.7 or greater is required.
Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7], download JDK 7, and install it. Then restart AnypointStudio.exe from where you unzipped the software distribution.

== Running Studio on a Mac

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Anypoint Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. If you have Administrator privileges, you can adjust the security settings under *System Preferences* > **Security & Privacy**. However, you can also right-click on the application to bypass the security warning and proceed to open the app.
