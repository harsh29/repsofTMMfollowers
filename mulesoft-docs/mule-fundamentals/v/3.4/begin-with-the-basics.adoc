= Begin with the Basics

The following sections aim to help you get up to speed on some key Mule concepts you'll need in order to follow the Shortcuts to Success. If you feel that you need more background on any of these concepts, follow the provided links to the appropriate reference material.

== Mule ESB

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|image:mule-esb-logo-medium.png[mule-esb-logo-medium] Mule ESB is lightweight, open-source middleware that provides comprehensive application integration. Using this enterprise service bus (ESB), developers can quickly and easily connect applications to exchange data following the service-oriented architecture (SOA) methodology.  Relative to the work of creating point-to-point connections between systems or applications, Mule applications are easy to build, because they leverage pre-packaged building blocks designed to “plug in” to the standardized interface provided by the Mule service bus.

== Mule Studio

**image:mule_studio.png[mule_studio]Mule Studio** is an Eclipse-based integration development environment (IDE) which includes both a graphical user interface and an XML editor for designing, developing, debugging and deploying applications. Whatever you do in the graphical interface gets translated into the XML editor and vice versa – something we call two-way editing. 

Beyond the core functionality of Mule ESB, Studio, as a graphical editor, supports a few extra special features: 

* **Anypoint™ DataMapper** translates and maps payloads from one data format to another; it can map input to output data fields as well as filter, enrich, and route message payloads. 
* *Mule DataSense* uses metadata to proactively acquire information via an Anypoint™ Connector during the application design stage. The information that DataSense retrieves, such as data type and structure, saves you significant design and testing time by intelligently prescribing mappings for the data in your application.

== Flows and Messages

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|image:flow1.png[flow1]Mule applications accept and process messages through a series of *message processors* plugged together in a *flow*. A typical flow has a *message source*, which accepts a message from an external source triggering the execution of the flow, and any number of *message processors*, which transform, filter, enrich, and otherwise process the message. A single flow can be a complete application by itself, or you can connect multiple flows together to create more complex applications.

link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.4/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial] 
|===

Mule applications also make use of *global elements*, which are reusable chunks of code that sit outside of flows and can be invoked by multiple elements in any flow within the application.

A Mule message consists of a *header* and a *payload*. The payload contains the message data, and the header contains metadata about the message in the form of *properties* and *variables*. Both properties and variables are key-value pairs that contain useful information about a message that help to get it where it's going.

== Message Processors

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|In Mule, use *Message Processors* to act upon a message to manipulate or enrich the message payload, or to add or remove message properties or variables. Divided into groups according to their function, each message processor falls into one of several categories:

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/error-handling[Error Handling]  +
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/business-events[Business Events] 
|===

* *Filters* limit processing of messages based on set criteria.
* *Components* execute specific logic upon a message, including custom-logic programmed in Java, Javascript, Groovy, Python or Ruby.
* *Routers* direct messages through different pathways in an application depending upon content or other set criteria.
* *Scopes* wrap snippets of code to define fine-grained behavior within a flow.
* *Transformers* convert data types and formats so as to "translate" messages between applications or systems.
* *Exception Strategies* handle any errors that occur during message processing.
* *Business Events* capture data related to key performance indicators

== Mule Expression Language


**image:expressionLang.png[expressionLang]Mule Expression Language (MEL)** is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule, allowing you to access, manipulate, and use information from the message and its environment. 

 At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:

*  extract information that it can use to process the current message
* set or manipulate a value in the message header or payload
* perform an operation on information in the message, application, Mule instance, or server

== Running Applications


image:pressPlay.png[pressPlay]Once you have created a Mule flow or series of flows, then what? How and where do you make the code come to life? The quickest, easiest way is to deploy your application on the embedded *Mule Server*, included with Mule Studio. There's a shiny *play* button on the top menu bar, just like in Eclipse. Click it and Studio deploys your application to a virtual server running on your machine.

This is great for testing, but probably not ideal for the final implementation of your service; there are several other deployment options to chose from:

* Export the application to a *Mule Enterprise Server*
* Deploy through the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager], either to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cludhub[CloudHub] or to an link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[on-premise server, server group or cluster]
* Deploy to an *API Gateway*
* Deploy the application in the *Mule Management Console's* Application Repository
