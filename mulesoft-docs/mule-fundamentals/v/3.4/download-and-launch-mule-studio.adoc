[WARNING]
====
*Running Studio on a Mac?*

If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra considerations to be mindful of when running Mule Studio.
====

==== Java Runtime Environment

Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 6 or 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: ` java -version`

The response should appear similar to the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_43-b01-447-11M4203)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01-447, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 6 or 7.

==== Application Execution

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Mule Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Mule Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. (Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to **Security & Privacy**.
. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:" select the radio button for *Anywhere*.
