= Anypoint B2B Overview
:keywords: b2b, introduction, portal, partner, manager

Anypoint B2B provides an integrated set of components to simplify the configuration and tracking required to implement typical B2B integrations in the Anypoint platform.

== Architecture

While the Anypoint B2B core services are hosted in Mulesoft's cloud, the Mule flows and connectors that interact with them may be run in CloudHub or on-premises.
The following diagrams show how these services work together in the context of Cloudhub or a Mule (on-premises) application.

== Anypoint Partner Manager

link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager[Anypoint Partner Manager] (APM) provides a single user interface for viewing and configuring Trading Partner Management settings and B2B Message Tracking data.

=== Partner Manager Connector

The Partner Manager Connector coordinates the saving and retrieval of TPM and Tracking data within the Mule Runtime. B2B-enabled connectors communicate with the Partner Manager Connector to request TPM data and to submit tracking data. The Partner Manager Connector handles local caching as well as communication with the TPM and Tracking APIs.

=== Partner Manager-enabled Connectors

The AS2, FTPS, X12,and EDIFACT connectors and modules are written to integrate with the Anypoint B2B core services for runtime retrieval of configuration data and for message tracking. The only setup required is to make sure the Partner Manager Connector module is configured with your API Key and to check the *Use B2B Provider* checkbox in the configuration screen of any B2B-enabled connector. Once this is set up, the Partner Manager Connector ensures that the configuration data for this connector is pulled at runtime from the TPM data and that tracking data are stored to the Anypoint B2B Message Tracking service.

=== Non-Partner Manager-enabled Connectors

For connectors that are not written to integrate with Anypoint B2B, the Partner Manager Connector can be used to store data to Message Tracking. The developer can include the Partner Manager Connector in the flow and determine the data that is sent to the message tracking system.
