== Supported Operations

The connector supports the following operations:

. <<Track Transmission>>

=== Track Transmission

This operation allows you to track transmissions that occur outside of Anypoint B2B Connectors like reading a
file from the filesystem. Tracking includes, but not only, keeping a record of the transmission's metadata, file's
content and format. Tracked transmissions are can viewed in Anypoint Partner Manager.

==== Example

The following is a sample config of the *Track transmission* operation:

The above operation will track who is the transmission's originator and receiver in addition to the file content,
filename, direction, and format type. User-defined metadata will also be tracked. The connector expects metadata to be
a _java.util.Map_. You have the option to define the map, representing metadata, inline via the *Object Browser*, or
alternatively, specify from the operation config its location in the Mule message:

As seen in the above screenshot, you can store any amount of metadata for a given transmission, including nested
metadata. Once Partner Manager has processed the tracking, you can view the recorded transmission from Partner
Manager:
