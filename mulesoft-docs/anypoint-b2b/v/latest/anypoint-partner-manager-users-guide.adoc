// image:b2b_intro_03.png[b2b_intro_03]

To configure a trading partnership using APM, you must:

. <<Set up a home organization>>
. <<Set up a trading partner>>

== Set up a home organization

The Home Organization, or _Home Org_, is you - that is, the company licensing Anypoint B2B.
To use Anypoint Partner Manager to manage your B2B transmissions, first create this Home Org in APM. After <<Getting Started>>, you can configure the following:

* <<Company information>>
* <<Company contact information>>
* <<Transport - Home Org>>
** <<AS2 Identity Settings - Home Org>>
* <<Format - Home Org>>
** <<X12 Identity Settings - Home Org>>
** <<EDIFACT Identity Settings - Home Org>>

=== Getting Started

. Start APM. The *Anypoint Platform* home page appears, with *B2B Transmissions* selected.
. Click *Trading Partners*.
. In the top right of the Trading Partners page, click the name of your company. The _Company_ page appears.

=== Company information

==== Enter Company information

. On the _Company_ page, the *Company Name* box auto-populates based on your account provisioning process. If appropriate, you can change it. This name appears in the upper right of the Trading Partners page.

. In the *API Key* box, click *Create an API key*. The API Application Program Interface (API) Key is a 32-bit alphanumeric universal unique identifier (UUID) string that APM generates for you; you use it to access the Anypoint B2B API.

WARNING: Store your API key in a secure location. If you lose it, you will need to create a new API key. APM does not store your API key.

A method of encoding in which a message is represented using a combination of 0s and 1s.

* *7-bit*
+
Data that is all represented as relatively short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation sequences.
No bytes with decimal values greater than 127 are allowed and neither are NULLs (bytes with decimal value 0).
CR (decimal value 13) and LF (decimal value 10) bytes only occur as part of CRLF line separation sequences.

* *8-bit*

Data that is all represented as relatively
short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation

Intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the US-ASCII character set.  It encodes the data in such a way that
the resulting bytes are unlikely to be modified by mail transport.
If the data being encoded are mostly US-ASCII text, the encoded form
of the data remains largely recognizable by humans.  A body which is
entirely US-ASCII may also be encoded in Quoted-Printable to ensure
the integrity of the data should the message pass through a
character-translating, and/or line-wrapping gateway.
