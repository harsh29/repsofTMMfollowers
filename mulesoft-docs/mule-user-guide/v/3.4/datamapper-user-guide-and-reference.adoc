*Anypoint(TM) DataMapper*, or DataMapper for short, is a Mule transformer that delivers simple, yet powerful, visual design of complex data transformations for use in Mule flows, including:

* Extraction and loading of flat and structured data formats
* Filtering, extraction and transformation of input data using XPath and powerful scripting
* Augmenting data with input parameters and lookups from other data sources
* Live design-time previews of transformation results
* High-performance, scalable data mapping operations

Inputs and outputs can be “flat” (that is, row-structured) data like CSV files or Excel spreadsheet data, or structured data in the formats supported throughout Mule: XML, JSON, key/value Maps and trees of Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).

In general, using the more basic Mule transformers to recreate the functionality of a single DataMapper may require a complex flow of format converters for input data, splitters, filters, For Each scopes, expressions, other transformers, aggregators, and yet more format converters for the output. A DataMapper-based implementation is faster to implement and easier to maintain than the alternatives.

Graphical design of the complex transformations supported by DataMapper makes it simple to apply all of its capabilities with little coding beyond basic expressions and function calls to transform data.

[NOTE]
====
*Full DataMapper functionality is exclusive to the Mule Enterprise runtimes.*

*But we want to give you a taste of what you’re missing!* Experiment with DataMapper in the Studio visual editor in a project that uses a Community Runtime to evaluate this powerful tool that maps data through a graphical interface. Not only can you develop your full-featured DataMapper application with a Community runtime, you can preview your data mappings as well.

However, to _RUN_ your application and observe DataMapper in a test or production environment, you must run the application with an Enterprise runtime.
