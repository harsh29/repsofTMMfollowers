= Splitter Flow Control Reference

*Purpose:* Using an expression, splits a message into separate fragments and then sends these fragments to the next message processor.

*Minimum Configuration:* The expression to use for splitting the incoming message and the evaluator indicating the programming language for evaluating the expression.

*Discussion:* Use the Splitter Flow Control to split a message into two or more parts based on an expression. After the message is split, Mule sends all message pieces to the next message processor in the flow.

To configure a Splitter, double-click its icon on the canvas and, in the Pattern Properties dialog, click the Splitter Properties tab.

Select the language of the expression from the Evaluator property pull-down list. Mule provides standard expression evaluators for json, ognl, xpath, jxpath, and groovy. If you have a custom evaluator and have registered it, that evaluator also appears in the list.

Enter the expression in the Expression property field.
