= DataMapper Excel to JSON Example

*_Enterprise Edition_*

This example illustrates Mule ESB's ability to transform and map data to facilitate communication across different media.

The application consists of two parts which perform the following activities:

*Part 1* imports Excel files, then submits T-shirt order requests to the Web service in Part 2;

*Part 2* receives Web service requests from Part 1, then sends emails to a vendor to fulfill T-shirt orders.

This document will help you understand some of the ways you can use Anypoint DataMapper to transform data formats in Mule ESB applications. To understand more about Mule ESB’s ability to integrate services and systems, access the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/mule-examples[Mule examples] and see other applications in action.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule ESB and the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/mule-studio-essentials[Mule Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/mule-studio[Mule Studio Tutorials].

This document describes the details of the example within the context of *Mule Studio*, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface (GUI). Where appropriate, the XML configuration follows the Studio interface screenshot in an expandable section.

== Set Up

For this example, you can create template applications straight out of the box in *Mule Studio* or *Mule Standalone* (Mule ESB without Studio). You can tweak the configurations of these use case-based templates to create your own customized applications in Mule.

Follow the procedure below to create the *Excel to JSON* example application in Mule ESB.

. Complete *steps 1 - 7* of the procedure in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/mule-examples[Examples and Exercises] to create a project from the *Excel to JSON* template in Mule Studio.

[WARNING]
Do not RUN the application until you have edited the `email.properties` file as per the following instructions.

. In the *Package Explorer*, click to expand the `src/main/java/` folder.
. Double-click the `email.properties` file to open the file in a new *canvas* tab in Studio (see image below).
+
image:email_props.png[email_props]

. Edit the file to include the correct information.
* For `mail_target`, enter the email address of the intended recipient
* For `mail_port`, enter the listening port of your site's mail server
* For `mail_host`, enter the hostname of your site's mail server
. Press the *Save* icon to save your changes to the file, then click the

. Double-click the *File Endpoint* building block in the first flow (the first building block in the `Import_Order` flow). The *Endpoint Properties* window pops up.
. In the *File Name Filter* section of the *Endpoint Properties* window, click the image:edit_fn_regex_icon.png[edit_fn_regex_icon] icon to edit the regular expression used to filter files.
+

+
[TIP]
====
The *File Endpoint* building block is configured to poll the `/tmp` directory, which does not exist in Windows. To replace `/tmp` with a directory of your choice (such as `C:\WINDOWS\TEMP`), complete the following steps:

. To edit the File Endpoint's properties, double-click the *File Endpoint* building block in the flow.
. At the *Endpoint Properties* window, type the name of the desired directory in the *Path* input box (see image below).
+

====

. In the *Package Explorer* pane in Studio, right-click the `mule-config.mflow` file and select `Run As > Mule Application`. Studio runs the application and Mule is up and kicking!
. Once started, the application begins polling the `/tmp` directory on your local drive for any file ending with the `.xls` extension. To see the application in action, copy the `tshirt-request.xls` file, located in the `<Project root>/src/test/resources` directory, to the `/tmp` directory.
+
*How to find your project's root directory*
+
[TIP]
====
To see the full path of your project's root directory, right-click the project root folder in the *Package Explorer* pane, then select *Properties*. Studio will display the *Properties* window for the project. Under *Resource*, the field *Location* lists the full path for the project's root directory (see image below):

image:rootfolder.png[rootfolder]
====

. When Mule detects the Excel file in the `/tmp` directory, it imports the file, processes the order, and send emails to the recipient specified in the `email.properties` file.
. To stop the application, click the red *Terminate* button in Studio's *Console*.

== How It Works

The application contains two link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/mule-application-architecture[flows] , which work together to process orders for t-shirts. The sections below offer flow-by-flow descriptions of the Excel to JSON application’s actions as it processes t-shirt orders.

[TIP]
====
*For Mule Studio Users*

In Mule Studio, double-click a building block to open its *Properties Panel*, then examine its configuration details. Alternatively, click the *Configuration XML* tab to examine the application's XML configuration file.

=== Part 1 - Import Order Flow

This flow polls the `/tmp` directory for files ending with `.xls` extensions. Mule uploads these files (which contain order details for t-shirts), then maps the data from the spreadsheet into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] in preparation for sending the data to the Web service in Part 2 for fulfillment.

<flow name="Import_Order" doc:name="Import_Order">
        <file:inbound-endpoint path="/tmp/" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File">
            <file:filename-regex-filter pattern=".*.xls" caseSensitive="false"/>
        </file:inbound-endpoint>
        <data-mapper:transform config-ref="t-shirt-to-request" doc:name="Data-mapper"/>
        <object-to-string-transformer doc:name="Object to String"/>
        <http:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" contentType="application/json" doc:name="HTTP"/>
    </flow>
----

The first link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/studio-building-blocks[building block] in the *Import Order* flow is an inbound **link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/file-endpoint-reference[File Endpoint]**. It regularly polls the contents of the `/tmp` directory to detect any file ending in the string `.xls`. When you copy an `.xls` file into the `/tmp` directory, the Excel to JSON application detects, then imports the file.

Next, an **link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/datamapper-transformer-reference[Anypoint DataMapper Transformer]** maps the Excel data to JSON format (see image below). +
 +
 image:datamapper1.png[datamapper1]

After transforming the data into a format that the Web service in Part 2 can read, the flow uses an *Object to String Transformer* to convert the data into a string. Then, Mule uses a one-way, outbound **link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/http-endpoint-reference[HTTP Endpoint]** to send the data to the Web service in Part 2, the *Request_Order_Service* flow.

[NOTE]
====
*Two-Way vs. One-Way*

Notice that the HTTP endpoint has a *one-way message exchange pattern* (as indicated by the small double-arrow icon — below, right). Because it has only to send information into a Web service, the HTTP endpoint in this example has a one-way message exchange pattern.

If an HTTP endpoint must respond to the requester, it requires a *request-response message exchange pattern* (below, left).

====

=== Part 2 - Request Order Service Flow

This flow accepts JSON-formatted Web service requests from Part 1 of the application. It maps the data from JSON to a Java object in preparation for iterative processing. Mule prepares, then sends one email to the vendor for each type of t-shirt order.

        <smtp:outbound-endpoint host="${mail_host}" port="${mail_port}" to="${mail_target}" from="${mail_from}" subject="${mail_subject}" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="SMTP"/>
    </foreach>
</flow>
----

The *Request Order Service* flow is a RESTful Web service which "listens" for HTTP requests from Part 1. When the inbound HTTP endpoint receives a request, it passes the message to the DataMapper. This transformer converts the incoming JSON-formatted http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type[array] to a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)[list] of TShirtRequest beans (see below). The message payload, now a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)[collection], is ready for iterative processing. +
 +
 image:datamapper2.png[datamapper2]

Next, Mule sends the collection to the **link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/foreach[Foreach]** iterative processor which breaks the collection apart into items, then processes each individual item one by one. In this case, each item is a line in the imported Excel spreadsheet (see image below) for which Mule will prepare an individual vendor email. +
 +
 image:excel_file_contents.png[excel_file_contents]

Each item in the collection first encounters a **link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/groovy-component-reference[Groovy Component]** which extracts two pieces of data from the payload:

. the amount of the product (i.e. the number of t-shirts)
. the product (i.e. the type of t-shirt)

The Groovy component uses the extracted data to prepare an email to the vendor to demand fulfillment of the order (see image below). Each email demands a specific number of a specific type of t-shirt. For example, the first item in the collection yields an email that reads, `You need to create 10 A0001.` +
 +
 image:groove_script.png[groove_script]

Lastly, the outbound *SMTP Endpoint* sends an email to the vendor with a demand to fulfill the order for t-shirts. Because it processes each item in the collection individually, Mule sends one email to the vendor for each type of t-shirt. From the Excel file included with this example, Mule sends six emails to the vendor, one for each row in the spreadsheet (excluding the header row). See the contents of a vendor email below.
