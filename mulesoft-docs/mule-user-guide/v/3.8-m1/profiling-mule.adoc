= Profiling Mule
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, profiling, yourkit, monitoring, performance, memory, cpu, tuning

Profiling Mule can be useful in helping you identify memory leaks in your custom Mule ESB extensions. https://www.yourkit.com/[YourKit] is a commonly used Java profiler for analyzing JVM performance. Hooking into YourKit can be achieved by <<profiling using the profiler pack>> or <<profiling with the YourKit agent>>. These methods are described below.

== Profiling with the YourKit Agent

YourKit allows you to remotely attach to a Java process using the remote attach wizard. This method is especially useful when you have ssh access to the Mule Server you'd like to profile and would rather not alter the Mule code itself to begin profiling.

=== Attaching the Profiler Agent

. Download the profiler at https://www.yourkit.com/download on to the Mule server.
. Unpackage the profiler.
. Determine the pid of Mule by running `jps`.
+
[source,shell]
----
jps
----
. Capture the pid of the `MuleContainerBootstrap`.
+
[source,txt]
----
2838 MuleContainerBootstrap
21311 Jps
----
. Within the YourKit package, open the `bin` directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd yjp-2015-build-15086/bin
----
. Run `yph.sh` including the `-attach` flag with the pid of `MuleContainerBootstrap`.
+
[source,shell]
----
./yph.sh -attach 2838
----
. Verify the agent is attached
+
[source,shell]
----
Attaching to process 2838 using default options
The profiler agent has attached. Waiting while it initializes...
The agent is loaded and is listening on port 10001.
You can connect to it from the profiler UI.
----

NOTE: Steps above can vary in a Windows environment. Check the YourKit documentation if the steps above cannot be translated.

=== Connecting the YourKit UI

. Launch YourKit on your local machine.
. In Monitor Remote Applications, click Connect to remote application.
+

. Setup your server username and password.
. Configure the SSH authentication.
+

. Click OK.
. After scanning for available applications, the YourKit should now be hooked up to your Mule instance.

== Profiling with the Profiler Pack

=== Installing the Profiler Pack

In order to identify memory leaks and to monitor resource usage, you can implement CPU and memory profiling to your Mule project.
If you are using Mule Enterprise Edition, you can use the included *Mule Profiler Pack* which uses YourKit 9.0. To use a different version of YourKit, instead of the one contained in the Profiler Pack, see the link:https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/features/[YourKit documentation] for the appropriate version and instructions on how to profile a Java application.

If you are installing Mule Community Edition, follow the instructions in our <<Profiling Using YourKit>> section.

When doing this with standalone Mule, any JVM flags need to be prefaced with `-M` so that they affect the Mule process rather than the wrapper process.

The Profiler Pack is contained in the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Mule Enterprise Edition download]. If you are installing Mule Enterprise Edition using the graphical installer, simply select the Profiler check box when installing the product.
The native profiler is available in the `$MULE_HOME/lib/native/profiler` path.

=== Running the Profiler

To run the profiler, you run Mule with the *-profile* switch plus any extra link:http://www.yourkit.com/docs/90/help/startup_options.jsp[YourKit startup options] with multiple parameters separated by commas, e.g. **-profile onlylocal,onexit=memory**. This integration pack will automatically take care of configuration differences for Java 1.4.x and 5.x/6.x.

For example:

[source, code, linenums]
----
./mule -profile
----

To expose the Mule Profiler Pack agent to JMX, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/jmx-management[JMX Management].

=== Embedded Mule

If you are running Mule embedded in a webapp, the Profiler configuration is completely delegated to the owning container. Launch YourKit Profiler, *Tools -> Integrate with J2EE server...* and follow the instructions. Typically, a server's launch script is modified to support profiling, and you then use this modified start script instead of the original.

== Hooking Mule into the YourKit Agent

In order to use your own *YourKit* profiler, you need to first download the build to the Mule host, and add the following line to the `wrapper.conf` file located in the `$MULE_HOME/conf` path.

[source,code,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.NN=-agentpath:<absolute-path-to-the-agent>=delay=10000
----

This enables the YourKit agent to interact with your Mule instance.

The <absolute-path-to-the-agent> value varies depending on the configuration and OS of your machine. Once you downloaded and expanded YourKit package content, you can usually find the agent inside the `/bin/` folder.

Assuming you downloaded `yjp-2013-build-13062` for Linux, for example, the entry to add in wrapper.conf should look like this:

[source,code,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.NN=-agentpath:/yjp-2013-build-13062/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so=delay=10000
----

Detailed installation instructions for different operative systems, can be found in the link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/[YourKit documentation].

[NOTE]
By default, Yourkit agent will scan for an internet facing port. If a specific port is desired, you can set it by adding: +
`wrapper.java.additional.NN=-agentpath:<absolute-path-to-the-agent>=delay=10000,port=<port>`. +
A full list of start up parameters can be found in link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/startup_options.jsp[YourKit startup options].

Restart Mule and set the YourKit profiler UI to connect to the host (with port, if specific port was specified). +
Check link:https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/running_profiler.jsp[YourKit documentation] for a more detailed explanation on how to properly launch the agent based on your operative system.
