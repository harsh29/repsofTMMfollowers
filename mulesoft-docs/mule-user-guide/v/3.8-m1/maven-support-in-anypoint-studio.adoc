= Maven Support in Anypoint Studio
:keywords: studio, maven, esb, version control, dependencies, libraries

The following sections describe how to enable or disable Maven support for your projects in Anypoint Studio. 

== Setting Your Maven Preferences

You can adjust your Studio preferences so that Studio automatically generates a `pom.xml` file upon project creation.  

. Navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences* (or Windows > Preferences in Windows).
. In the *Preferences* panel, click to expand *Anypoint Studio*, then select *Maven Settings*.
. Click to select both *Enable Maven support in Anypoint Studio* and **Enable automatic maintenance of pom.xml**.

. Adjust the filepath of the *Maven installation home directory* on your local drive, if it is empty or if you wish to use a different installation than the one Studio detected automatically.
. Click *Test Maven Configuration* to instruct Studio to run `mvn --version` in the background to validate your Maven installation. Studio produces an output of that command in a box below the button. The results will flag any problems with your settings, such as a missing JAVA_HOME environment variable.

[WARNING]
====
*OS X Mavericks*

**If you are running OS X Mavericks, Studio cannot automatically find your Maven installation**, so your home directory field will be blank and the Maven support boxes unchecked. 

To use Maven with Anypoint Studio on Mavericks, configure your Maven home directory manually. Once you have configured a valid Maven home, click *Test Maven Configuration* to verify your settings.
====
. When finished, click *OK* to save your changes.

== Disabling Maven Support in Studio

You can adjust your Studio preferences so that Studio does not auto-generate a `pom.xml` file for new projects.  The following procedure outlines the steps to disable Maven support in your instance of Studio.

. Navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences* (or Windows > Preferences in Windows).
. In the *Preferences* panel, click to expand *Anypoint Studio*, then select *Maven Settings*.
. Click to deselect both *Enable Maven support in Anypoint Studio* and **Enable automatic maintenance of pom.xml**. 
. Click *OK* to save changes to Preferences.

When you create a new project in Studio, the option to Use Maven is grayed out.

Click *configure Maven* to re-enable Maven for your Studio instance, or return to the Preferences and adjust your settings there.

== Disabling Maven Support in a Single Studio Project

If you have created Maven project in Studio and wish to disable Maven support for that particular project, right-click the project name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Mule* > *Disable Support*. Though it does not remove the `pom.xml` file, Studio ceases to maintain it for the project. 

You can re-enable Maven support via the Studio menu item if you _did not_ delete the `pom.xml` file. Right-click the project name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Mule* > *Enable Support*.

[WARNING]
If you disable *Maven support* in your Studio project _and_ delete the `pom.xml` file, you cannot re-enable it via the Maven Support in Studio menu item. To re-initiate Maven support, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project[Enabling Maven Support for a Studio Project] documentation.
