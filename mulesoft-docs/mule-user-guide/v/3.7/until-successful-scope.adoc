= Until Successful Scope
:keywords: anypoint studio, studio, mule, until successful, reattempts, retry

The *until-successful* scope processes messages through the processors within it until the process succeeds. By default, until-successful's processing occurs asynchronously from the main flow. After passing a message into the until-successful scope, the main flow immediately regains control of the thread. However, you can configure until-successful to run synchronously relative to the main flow.

Until-successful repeatedly retries to process a message which is attempting to complete an activity such as:

* Dispatching to outbound endpoints, for example, when calling a remote web service that may have availability issues
* Executing a component method, for example, when executing on a Spring bean that may depend on unreliable resources
* Executing a subflow

== Success and Failure

As this scope continues to processes messages until successful, it is important to understand the definition of successful in context of Mule message processing.

[width"100%",cols="10a,90a"]
|===
|FAILURE |A message processor within the until-successful scope throws and exception or contains an exception payload. Also, if an expression is provided in the attribute `failureExpression` and it evaluates to true.
|SUCCESS |None of the message processors within the until-successful scope throw any exceptions or contain an exception payload, or they do not return any message at all (i.e. the flow ends in a one-way outbound endpoint)
|_conditional_ |Where you have configured a failure expression (see below), Mule evaluates the return message against the expression to dynamically determine if the action has failed or succeeded.
|===

=== Basic Attributes

The following table provides a description of the main configurable attributes of the element:

[width"100%",cols="10a,90a",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|`objectStore-ref` |Reference to the org.mule.api.store.ListableObjectStore that is used to store events pending to process or reprocess.
|`maxRetries` |Specifies the maximum number of retries that are attempted.
|`millisBetweenRetries` |Specifies the minimum interval between two attempts to process, in milliseconds. The actual interval depends on the previous execution, but should not exceed twice this number. The default value is 60000 milliseconds (one minute).
|`failureExpression` |Specifies an expression that, when it evaluated to true, determines that the processing of one route was a failure. If no expression is provided, only an exception is treated as a processing failure.
|`ackExpression` |Specifies an expression that, when evaluated to true, determines the synchronous response of until-successful.
|`deadLetterQueue-ref` |The endpoint or message processor to which undeliverable messages are sent after all retries have been executed unsuccessfully.
|===

=== Configuring failureExpression

If the scope fails, a `RetryPolicyExhaustedException` is created, wrapped as a `MessagingException` and passed to the exception handler of the flow that contains the `until-successful` element.

The following illustrates how to configure the `failureExpression` returned by an until-successful scope:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<until-successful objectStore-ref="objectStore"
                  failureExpression="#[message.inboundProperties['http.status'] != 202]"
                  maxRetries="6" secondsBetweenRetries="600">
    <http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="flakey" method="POST" doc:name="HTTP"/>
</until-successful>
----

=== Configuring a Dead Letter Queue

To manage messages which have exhausted the number of `maxRetries` within the until-successful scope, you can define a DLQ (dead letter queue) endpoint to which Mule can send such messages. Refer to the code sample below for an example configuration.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<until-successful objectStore-ref="objectStore"
                  deadLetterQueue-ref="dlqChannel"
                  maxRetries="3"
                  secondsBetweenRetries="10">
...
</until-successful>
----

== Asynchronous Until-Successful

By default, until-successful processes messages asynchronously relative to the main flow in which it resides. The section below describe configurations you can customize in your asynchronous until-successful.

=== Until-Successful and Object Store

This message processor needs an link:http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.2.0-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/index.html?org/mule/api/store/ListableObjectStore.html[ListableObjectStore] instance in order to persist messages pending (re)processing. There are several implementations available in Mule, including the following:

* DefaultInMemoryObjectStore: default in-memory store
* DefaultPersistentObjectStore: default persistent store
* FileObjectStore: file-based store
* QueuePersistenceObjectStore: global queue store
* SimpleMemoryObjectStore: in-memory store


See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-object-stores[Mule Object Stores] for further information about object stores in Mule. The following code sample illustrates how to configure an in-memory store:


[source, xml]
----
<spring:bean id="objectStore" class="org.mule.util.store.SimpleMemoryObjectStore" />

=== Customizing the Threading Profile of Asynchronous Until-Successful

This feature enables you to customize the threading profile of an asynchronous until-successful scope. 

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

. In the *Properties Editor* of the Until Successful Scope in your flow, click to access the *Threading* tab.
. Click to select the *Configure threading profile* radio button.
. Enter values in the threading profile fields to customize the threading behavior.

|*Attribute* |*Type* |*Required* |*Description*
|*Max Buffer Size* |integer |no |Determines how many requests are queued when the pool is at maximum usage capacity and the pool exhausted action is WAIT. The buffer is used as an overflow.*
|*Max Active Threads* |integer |no |The maximum number of threads to use.
|*Max Idle Threads* |integer |no |The maximum number of idle or inactive threads that can be in the pool before they are destroyed.
|*Pool Exhausted Action* |WAIT, DISCARD, DISCARD_OLDEST, ABORT, RUN |no |When the maximum pool size or queue size is bounded, this value determines how to handle incoming tasks. Possible values are: WAIT (wait until a thread becomes available; don't use this value if the minimum number of threads is zero, in which case a thread may never become available), DISCARD (throw away the current request and return), DISCARD_OLDEST (throw away the oldest request and return), ABORT (throw a RuntimeException), and RUN (the default; the thread making the execute request runs the task itself, which helps guard against lockup).
|*Thread TTL* |integer |no |Determines how long an inactive thread is kept in the pool before being discarded.
|*Thread Wait Timeout* |integer |no |How long to wait in milliseconds when the pool exhausted action is WAIT. If the value is negative, it waits indefinitely.
|===

* Any `BlockingQueue` may be used to transfer and hold submitted tasks. The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
** If fewer than `corePoolSize` threads are running, the Executor always prefers adding a new thread rather than queuing.
** If `corePoolSize` or more threads are running, the Executor always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread.*
** If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task is rejected.
If you configure a threading profile with `poolExhaustedAction=WAIT` and a `maxBufferSize` of a positive value, the thread pool does not grow from maxThreadsIdle (corePoolSize) towards maxThreadsActive (maxPoolSize) _unless_ the queue is completely filled up.

To the until-successful element, add child element  `threading-profile` . Configure the attributes of the child element according to the table below.

[source, xml, linenums]

|*maxBufferSize* |integer |no |Determines how many requests are queued when the pool is at maximum usage capacity and the pool exhausted action is WAIT. The buffer is used as an overflow.*
|*maxThreadsActive* |integer |no |The maximum number of threads to use.
|*maxThreadsIdle* |integer |no |The maximum number of idle or inactive threads that can be in the pool before they are destroyed.
|*poolExhaustedAction* |WAIT, DISCARD, DISCARD_OLDEST, ABORT, RUN |no |When the maximum pool size or queue size is bounded, this value determines how to handle incoming tasks. Possible values are: WAIT (wait until a thread becomes available; don't use this value if the minimum number of threads is zero, in which case a thread may never become available), DISCARD (throw away the current request and return), DISCARD_OLDEST (throw away the oldest request and return), ABORT (throw a RuntimeException), and RUN (the default; the thread making the execute request runs the task itself, which helps guard against lockup).
|*threadTTL* |integer |no |Determines how long an inactive thread is kept in the pool before being discarded.
|*threadWaitTimeout* |integer |no |How long to wait in milliseconds when the pool exhausted action is WAIT. If the value is negative, it waits indefinitely.

* Any BlockingQueue may be used to transfer and hold submitted tasks. The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
** If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor always prefers adding a new thread rather than queuing.
** *If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread.*
** If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task is rejected.

If you configure a threading profile with poolExhaustedAction=WAIT and a maxBufferSize of a positive value, the thread pool does not grow from maxThreadsIdle (corePoolSize) towards maxThreadsActive (maxPoolSize) _unless_ the queue is completely filled up.

== Synchronous Until-Successful

Out of the box, the until-successful scope processes messages asynchronously. After passing a message into the until-successful scope, the main flow immediately regains control of the thread thus prohibiting any returned response from the processing activities which occur within the scope. 

However, in some situations, you may need until-successful to process messages synchronously so that the main flow waits for processing within the scope to complete before continuing processing. To address these needs, the Mule enables you to configure the scope to process messages synchronously.

When set to process message synchronously, until-successful executes within the thread of the main flow, then returns the result scope's processing on the same thread. 

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

In the *Threading* tab of the Until Successful's *Properties Editor*, click to select *Synchronous*.

image:until_successful.png[image]

....
[tab,title="XML Editor or Standalone"]
....

To the until-successful element, add the `synchronous` attribute with the value set to `true`.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<until-successful synchronous="true">
     <set-payload/>
</until-successful>
----

....
------

When set to process synchronously, the until-successful scope does not accept the configuration of the following child element and attributes:

* `threading-profile` (synchronous until-successful does not need a ThreadPool)
* `objectStore-ref` (synchronous until-successful is not required to persist messages between retries)
* `deadLetterQueue-ref` (when the retry count is exhausted, Mule executes the exception strategy)
