= Hardware and Software Requirements
:keywords: esb, mule, requirements, os, jdk, installation, jre

This page lists the hardware, operating systems, Java, and other requirements to run MuleSoft products.

== Mule ESB

=== Mule Hardware Requirements

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs).

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

=== Mule Software Requirements

Because the only mandatory requirement for Mule ESB is Java, Mule ESB should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JREs.

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs).

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments

== DevKit Versions

Any version of Anypoint DevKit from 3.5 and newer is compatible with
all Mule versions 3.5 and newer. Anypoint DevKit version numbering
does not correspond to Mule versions. For example, DevKit 3.8 is
compatible with Mule versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

We recommend using the latest version of Mule with DevKit to get the
latest fixes and improvements.

* link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/persisting-mmc-data-to-ms-sql-server[MS SQL Server]

=== Run MMC as a Web Application

Mule Management Console should be run as a web application deployed on a web container such as JBoss or Tomcat, and NOT as a Mule application. We recommend configuring the web application server's memory areas with the following minimum sizes:

*  Heap: 2GB (3GB recommended) 
*  Permanent Generation: 512MB
