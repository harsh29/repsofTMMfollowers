Twilio is a cloud communications Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It provides an API for making and receiving telephone calls, and sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to their free sandbox service to send SMS text-messages. You can then configure the Twilio connector in Anypoint Studio with your API credentials.

To create a new Twilio account, go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio and register under "Try Twillio Free".

== Obtain API Credentials

After you log in to your developer account, you see the Twilio dashboard. Note the *Account SID* and *Auth Token* values provided. Copy these credentials into the Twilio connector configuration menu in Anypoint Studio.

As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Anypoint Studio connector configuration, be sure that you do not copy in additional leading/trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.
