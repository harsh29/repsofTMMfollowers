= Available Transports

[WARNING]
*This topic relates to the most recent version of Mule ESB* +
To see the corresponding topic in a previous version of Mule ESB, click http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULE2USER/Available+Transports[here]

Following is a list of known transports (also called "providers") for Mule ESB. Some functionality is contained within modules instead of transports--see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/modules-reference[Modules Reference]. For more information on transports, see the following topics:

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/connecting-using-transports[About Transports]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/configuring-a-transport[Configuring a Transport]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/creating-transports[Creating Transports]

If you have created a transport for Mule and would like to share it with the Mule community, please mailto:dev@mule.codehaus.org[contact us].

The following list includes some prominent transports from MuleForge (denoted by image:/documentation-3.2/download/attachments/29425751/ftiny.png?version=1&modificationDate=1228493197476[image,title="Available on MuleForge only"]). Transports that are available only in Mule Enterprise are denoted by #Unable to render embedded object: File (eetiny.png) not found.#.

Note that in Mule 3, CXF and Jersey are no longer classed as transports. They are now modules that use an underlying transport (for instance HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate between client ans service.
