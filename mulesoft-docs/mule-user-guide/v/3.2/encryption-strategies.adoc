= Encryption Strategies

The Security Manager can be configured with one or more encryption strategies that can then be used by encryption transformers, security filters, or secure transports such as link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/ssl-and-tls-transports-reference[SSL] or link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/http-transport-reference[HTTPS]. These encryption strategies can greatly simplify configuration for secure messaging as they can be shared across components.

Following is an example of a password-based encryption strategy (PBE) that provides password-based encryption using JCE. Users must specify a password and optionally a salt and iteration count as well. The default algorithm is PBEWithMD5AndDES, but users can specify any valid algorithm supported by JCE.

<security-manager>
    <password-encryption-strategy name="PBE" password="mule"/>
</security-manager>

This strategy can then be referenced by other components in the system such as filters or transformers.
