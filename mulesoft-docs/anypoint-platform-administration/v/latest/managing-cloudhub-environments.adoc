= Managing CloudHub Environments
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, cloudhub

CloudHub lets you create separate environments for applications and servers, which are independent from each other. Environments can either be of *production* or *sandbox* type. By default, when creating a new organization you get one production environment named *Production*. 

Sandbox environments are helpful restrictive environments for developers and testers, they facilitate safe testing of applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team in which they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment, thereby securing production and eliminating the risk of a developer accidentally operating upon an application in production. After you are sure the application is safe to expose to your users, you can then easily promote an application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

== Switching Environments

After you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them. From any screen in the CloudHub platform, you can switch to a different environment by clicking the current environment, displayed in the upper left corner of the screen, and picking another environment.

== Migrating an Application to Production

After you create an application in a sandbox environment and tested it, you eventually want to migrate it to production. To do so, create a new app in your production environment, then when picking the application file, instead of choosing a file, click *Get from sandbox*.

You can then choose between your sandbox environments, and select an application to deploy in production.

=== Limitations

* Only a *CloudHub* Administrator can move applications between environments. 
* To avoid domain name conflict, an application cannot exist in two environments at the same time. Alter the application's name slightly to deploy it to another environment.
* You cannot move the same application into the same environment. CloudHub prevents you from duplicating applications in a single environment. If you wish to have the same, or similar applications in a single environment, modify one application's file to distinguish it from the original.
