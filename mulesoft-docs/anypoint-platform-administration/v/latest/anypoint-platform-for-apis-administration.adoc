= Anypoint Platform for APIs Administration
:keywords: administration, api, organization, users, gateway, theme

== Prerequisites

This section assumes you are a member of the Organization Administrator role for your organization.

== The Organization Administrator Role

As an Organization Administrator, you can:

* Invite users to your organization
* Assign users to roles to define their permissions in the platform
* Edit and remove users from your organization
* Configure organization settings
* Access your organization's client ID and client secret, needed for configuring your API Gateway instances
* Access analytics for the APIs in your organization

Only users in the Organization Administrator role have these privileges. You can add other users to this role to share administrative permissions with them.

== Organization Settings

To access the Organization Administration page:

. Log into an Organization Administrator account.
. In the upper right corner of the screen, click image:gearicon.png[gearicon.png]. 

Tabs provide access categories of features on the Organization Administration page:

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform[Users]
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform[Roles]
* Organization
* link:/anypoint-platform-administration/setting-up-external-identity[External Identity]

The *Organization* tab displays your organization name, which was created when your organization was first provisioned. You can edit this name by clicking the name. The original organization name determines your organization's portal domain. However, your portal domain is independently editable as well. Adjusting the portal domain affects the deep links to any existing API Portals in your organization.

== Client ID and Client Secret

Each organization has a *client ID* and a *client secret* that authenticate it. These values are required for configuring an on-premises API Gateway or for deploying proxies or APIs to an API Gateway hosted on CloudHub.

To obtain the values of these credentials for your organization, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right and then select the *Organization* tab.

== Troubleshooting

If you need to change your organization's client ID or client secret, please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft support].

== Customizing Your Theme

You can customize the look and feel of your Developer Portal and all API Portals in your organization to contain your company logo or other image, and to use your branded colors. Click *Site Settings* from the API Administration page to access the *Edit Theme* dialog, then customize to fit your organization.

Note that this menu is only visible to Organization Administrators.

The changes you make on this window appear on all API Portals in your organization, unless those API Portals have had their themes customized at the portal level. Individual API Portal custom themes override organization-wide custom themes.
