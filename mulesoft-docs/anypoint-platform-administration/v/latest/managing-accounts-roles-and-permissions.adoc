This document explains the available menus for adjusting your settings, and its users within your organization and its business groups. Depending on your user role, you may not have access to all the functionality below, but all users can at least adjust their own profile information.

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, that you have been assigned as the administrator of one of the business groups of your Organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and that you want to manage user permissions for an API version, a business group or the entire orgnaization.

== How Permissions Work in the Anypoint Platform

In the Anypoint Platform, users belong to an organization and have a set of roles and permissions. API versions and CloudHub deployment environments are grouped under organizations (and optionally under business groups too), to access them you need to have an account that that owns the necessary permissions and that belongs to its corresponding organization – and to the business group if the resource exists in one.

Roles and permissions can be granted for accessing resources that exist in the master organization, or for resources that exist within a business-group. Roles that are assigned at the master organization level can only reference resources that are at the master organization level, roles that belong to a business group can only reference resources within that business group. A user that owns any role of a business group is implicitly granted membership in the business group.

Each role contains a list of permissions that define what a user that holds that role can do with the specific resources it scopes. Permissions can also be added at an individual user level, without the need for roles. There are two different types of permissions: those that are for API versions and those that are for CloudHub environments. Keep in mind that API permissions are API version specific and CloudHub permissions are environment specific – they grant you the ability to do something within a particular API version / environment, not the entire organization. The only exceptions to that rule are the roles *API Version Owner* – which grants ownership of all APIs and all of their versions within the corresponding business group – and *Portals Viewer* – which grants viewing access to all portals in the corresponding business group.

== Updating Your Name, Email and Password

Once logged in, select *Your Profile* on the top right menu.You can easily update your basic account information from here:

There you'll be able to modify your name, email, change your password and see a list of the roles assigned to your account.

== Manage the Users of an Organization or Business Group

_Admin Only_

As an Admin of your organization, or of one of its business groups, you can enable, disable, or delete the users in it, as well as invite people to register a new Anypoint Platform account associated to your organization. Access this menu by first making sure that the correct business group is selected in the top-right of the screen next to your user name, then clicking the gear icon next to it, and then picking the appropriate link in the left menu.

image:organizations.png[organizations]

By ticking the checkbox next to a user, a few more options related to that user are displayed, specifically *enable*, *disable* and *delete*.

You can then invite other users to join the organization you've created in the Anypoint Platform by clicking the green *Invite Users* button. Invited users have access to the same set of resources as you (although they may have different roles that can restrict what they can view or do). They will receive an email inviting them, and if they click through the link they will be presented a sign-up form that already has the *Company* field completed, matching your organization.

image:invite.png[invite]

You can also pick the *Pending Invites* tab to view invitations that have been sent but that haven't been confirmed by the users yet.

By clicking on a username in the table below, you can access more information about that user, add roles and permissions to it, or reset its password.

image:user+permissions.jpeg[user+permissions]

To add roles or permissions to a user, pick the corresponding tab, making sure you're in the right business group, then:

* For API Permissions: write the name of the API you want to give access to, then pick a version and permission
* For CloudHub Permissions: write the name of the CloudHub environment to want to give access to, then pick a permission
* For Roles: write the name of the role you want to grant

[WARNING]
If you're navigating the "users" menu of a specific business group, you can only assign roles and permissions that are related to resources that exist in that business group. To assign a user roles that belong to a different business group, you must first shift to navigate the settings of that business group by clicking the menu next to your username at the top-right of the screen.

Then fill in the necessary fields and commit your choice by clicking the green checkmark.

If necessary, you can also remove user permissions. Note that if users have been granted their permission via a role, you cannot view or remove those role-based permissions here, you must do it via the *Roles* section of the menu.

== Manage Roles

_Admin Only_

As an Admin of your organization, you can create or delete roles, define what permissions each grants, and what users own it. As the owner of a business group, you can create and define roles and permissions within that business group, granting access only to resources that exist within that business group. To access this menu, first make sure you're in the correct business group (by clicking the menu next to your username on the top-right of the screen), then click the gear icon next to it, and then pick the appropriate link in the left menu.

Click the Add Role button to add a new role. Once created, you can look for it on the table and click on it to add permissions, API resources, and users to it. By ticking the checkbox next to a role, the delete button becomes visible.

|API Versions Owner |Ownership of every API and every version of it within the current organization or business group
|Portals Viewer |Viewing permission for every API Portal in the current organization or business group
|===

The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the Organization Owner. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

When the Organization Owner creates a business-group, he assigns a user as the owner of it. This user holds an Administrator role within this business group by default.

If you click on a role, you can edit it. Change its name or description, add or remove permissions – both for API resources and CloudHub environments, and add or remove users to it.

=== CloudHub Permissions

There are two ways to assign CloudHub permissions. One way is to add them to Anypoint Platform roles, and then assign those roles to users. The other is to assign permissions directly to individual users in the Users menu previously described.

To add CloudHub permissions to a role do the following

. Make sure you're in the right business group
. Pick the Cloudhub Permissions tab
. Click in the green region labelled *Add an environment by name*
. Type in the name of one of the environments existing in your organization (if these environments belong to a business group, they are only be available when creating a role in that same business group)
. Now you are able to select what permissions to grant within that environment. You can also pick *Select All* to assign all permissions related to that environment to that role.

[WARNING]
Note that CloudHub permissions are each specific to a single environment, so if you have multiple environments and want to give a role the same permissions on all, you must add these permissions multiple times, one for each environment.

You can also assign CloudHub permissions directly to a specific user (not a role), you can do this by going to the *Users* menu, selecting a user, and then following the same steps as above. Note that the user must already be a member of your organization for you to grant permissions.

=== API Permissions

There are two ways to assign API permissions. One way is to add them to Anypoint Platform roles, and then assigning those roles to users. The other is to assign permissions directly to individual users in the Users menu previously described or from an API version details page.

To add API permissions to a role do the following:

. Make sure you're in the right business group
. Pick the API Permissions tab
. Click in the green region labelled *Add an API resource by name*
. Type in the name of one of the APIs existing in your organization (if these APIs belong to a business group, they are only be available when creating a role in that same business group)
. Now you are be able to select what permissions to grant within what specific versions of that API . You can also pick *All versions* to assign permissions for all current and future versions of that API.

image:api+permissions.jpeg[api+permissions]

You can also assign API permissions directly to a specific user (not a role), you can do this by going to the *Users* menu, selecting a user, and then following the same steps as above. Note that the user must already be a member of your organization for you to grant permissions. As an alternative you can also do the following:

. Navigate to the API version page
. Select the Permissions tab
. Search for a user by name and assign a permission

image:api+permissions+on.jpeg[api+permissions+on]

The types of permissions you can assign for APIs are the following:

* *API Version Owner*: API Version Owners can view specific versions of the API that they own. API Version Owners inherit Portal Viewer permissions by default for any API Portals that you create for the API versions they own.
* *Portal Viewer*: Portal Viewers can see a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. Note that the ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API. Also note that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.

=== Data Gateway Permissions

Data Gateway permissions are assigned directly to individual users in the Users menu previously described.

You can do this by going to the *Users* menu, selecting a user, and following these steps:

. Make sure you're in the right business group
. Pick the Data Gateway Permissions tab
. Click in the green region labelled * Add an environment by name*
. Type in the name of one of your environments existing in your organization (if these environments belong to a business group, they are only be available when creating a role in that same business group)
. Now you are able to seleet what permissions to grant within that environment. You can also pick *Select All* to assign all permissions related to that environment to that role.

Note that the user must already be a member of your organization for you to grant permissions.
