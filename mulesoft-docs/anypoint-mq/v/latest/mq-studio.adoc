== Anypoint Studio MQ Connector

This section describes how to install the Anypoint MQ connector in Anypoint Studio and how to configure Studio to handle applications.

To add the Anypoint MQ connector to Studio:

. In Studio, click the *X* in the upper left of Studio:
+
image:mq-exchange-x.png[Exchange X icon in the Studio task bar]
+
. In Anypoint Exchange, search for `anypoint mq`:
+
image:mq-exchange-search-for-mq.png[mq-exchange-search-for-mq]
+
. Click *Install*.
. Type your first and last name, email address, and telephone number. Click the checkbox to agree to the MuleSoft terms of service:
+
image:mq-install-prompt.png[mq-install-prompt]
+
. Click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the *Anypoint MQ* connector.

== Create a Client App

Creating a client app provides the client ID and client secret you can use to register an app as either an Anypoint MQ publisher or subscriber.

. In Anypoint Platform, click *MQ*.
. Click *Client Apps* from the left nav bar:
+

+
. Click the blue plus circle:
+
image:mq-blue-plus-circle.png[Create client app circle button about two-thirds to the right below the task bar]
+
. Specify the name of the client application.
+
image:mq-create-client-app-window.png[mq-create-client-app-window]
+
. Click *Save Changes*.
. Click the client app entry to view the client ID and secret values:
+
image:mq-client-apps-detail.png[mq-client-apps-detail]
+
. Click the Copy button for the ID or secret to copy the value to your computer's clipboard.

*Note*: If using the Chrome browser and the Copy buttons don't function, click *Settings* > *Show advanced settings* > *Privacy* > *Content settings* > *Plugins* > *Detect and run important plugin content*.

== Add a Client App to Studio

To add a client app to Studio:

. In Anypoint Platform, click *MQ* > *Client Apps*:
+
image:mq-client-apps-in-nav.png[mq-client-apps-in-nav]
+
. Create a client app. Note the Client ID and Client Secret values. We use these later when we configure the Anypoint MQ connector in Anypoint Studio.
. In Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Search for "http" and drag the *HTTP* connector to the Studio Canvas. Click the HTTP connector, and click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*. Click *OK* to accept the defaults.
. Search for "mq" and drag the *Anypoint MQ* connector to the canvas.
. Click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
. In the Global Element Properties window:
.. Copy the *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Client App* > *Client App ID* value to Studio's *Client ID* field.
.. Copy the *Client App* > *Client Secret* value to Studio's *Client Secret* field. You can ignore the other settings to test your first connector.
.. Set *Max Redelivery* to *-1* to ensure that Anypoint MQ keeps retrying to deliver a message that is not delivered. The -1 value indicates that there is no limit to retries.
+

+
If you want to set the remaining fields or tabs, see <<Advanced Global Element Properties>>.
+
.. Click *OK*.
. Click the *Operation* field and specify an operation such as Publish or Consume.
. Specify the *Destination* as the name of the Queue or Exchange that you set in Anypoint Platform.

== Advanced Global Element Properties

This section provides information about all the Global Element Properties screens.

=== General Tab

image:mq-global-element-props-full.png[mq-global-element-props-full]

The General tab fields are:

[width="100%",cols="20a,5a,5a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Req'd |Default |Description
|Name |yes |none |Configuration name.
|Provider +
Use Provider Config |yes |none |Sets a provider configuration for the current app.
available to all applications.
|URL |yes |none |URL shown in Anypoint Platform:

image:mq-ap-url.png[URL in MQ near top of UI]
|Client App ID |yes |none |From Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client Apps. Click the app and copythe  Client App ID value.
|Client Secret |yes |none |From Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client Apps. Click the app and copy the Client Secret value.
|Use Global Provider Config |no |none |Sets the URL, Client App ID, and Client Secret for all apps.
|Basic Settings +
Max Redelivery |no |-1 |Number of redeliveries
to try in case a message fails. -1 indicates that Anypoint MQ retry indefinitely.
|[[am]]Acknowledgement Mode |no |none|Defines how the Anypoint MQ messages are acknowledged when the message are removed from being inflight messages. Possible values are:

* AUTO (Default)- Messages are acknowledged or negatively acknowledged depending on whether or not exceptions occur. See link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[Acknowledgement Mode] for more information.
* MANUAL - Messages are acknowledged using a custom ACK message processor.
* NONE - Messages are acknowledged and removed as soon as they are received.
|Acknowledgement Timeout |no |none |When you take an Anypoint MQ message from a queue, the broker puts it in flight, and the message remains in that state until the ACK is performed (application reads the message and Anypoint MQ deletes it), or the Acknowledgement Timeout is reached. If ACK is performed, then the message is removed from the queue, if Acknowledgement Timeout is reached, the message returns to the queue.
|Pooling Time |no |10000 |Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the expected message or messages.
|Threading Profile Settings +
Define threading profile behavior +
Use default worker threading profile |no |none |See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance]. The threading profile options let you optimize connector performance for use with Anypoint MQ.
|Use custom worker threading profile |no |none |See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].
|Max Active Threads |no |none |The maximum number of threads to use. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].
|Max Idle Threads |no |none |The maximum number of idle or inactive threads that can be in the pool before they are destroyed. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance]. The thread pool does not grow from Max Idle Threads towards Max Active Threads unless the queue is completely filled up.
|Thread TTL |no |none |Thread time to live duration.
|Pool Exhausted Action |no |none |When the maximum pool size or queue size is bounded, this value determines how to handle incoming tasks. Possible values are: WAIT (wait until a thread becomes available; donâ€™t use this value if the minimum number of threads is zero, in which case a thread may never become available), DISCARD (throw away the current request and return), DISCARD_OLDEST (throw away the oldest request and return), ABORT (throw a RuntimeException), and RUN (the default; the thread making the execute request runs the task itself, which helps guard against lockup).
|Thread Wait Timeout |no |none |Thread wait timeout in milliseconds.
|Max Buffer Size |no |none |Max buffer size.

=== TLS/SSL and Proxy Tabs

The TSL/SSL and Proxy tabs share the same information as the
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-connector[HTTP Connector].

=== Prefetch Tab

Number of messages to receive at once when asking for messages. The response can contain fewer messages than this number depending on the `poolingTime` setting.

When you subscribe a flow to an Anypoint MQ queue, the flow pool regularly polls the queue looking for messages. This operation can be very time consuming. In order to avoid delays, prefetch was introduced. This is a component placed between the flow and the Anypoint MQ queue that polls the queue regularly, but without processing the pooled messages. You can change these values depending
on your site's performance and use case needs.

image:mq-prefetch-general.png[mq-prefetch-general]

The Prefetch tab fields are:

[width="100%",cols="20a,50a",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description
|Fetch Size |Number of messages to prefetch.
|Fetch Timeout |Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the required amount of messages. When this time elapses, the response is sent with as many messages as taken during the period.
|Frequency |The duration in milliseconds to execute
the retrieve operation when the prefetch queue is not empty.
|===

*Note*: For best performance, set `Fetch Size` to 10 (maximum value) and reduce `Frequency` to increase the pooling time and the resulting dequeuing of transactions per second (TPS). You can increase `Fetch Timeout` if message processing is slow. For example, if processing takes 5 seconds, set the `Fetch Timeout` to at least double this time (10000 milliseconds).

Apart from these performance-related parameters, it is important to properly configure the xref:am[Acknowledgement Mode].
