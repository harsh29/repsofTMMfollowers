|Learn about:

* <<Create an Admin Role>> - Create an admin's role for all permissions - Helps you define who in your organization should administer MQ versus have lesser permissions.
* <<Exchanges>> - Create exchanges, and send messages.
|===

== Configure Anypoint Platform

In the sections that follow, we use Anypoint Platform to assign an administrative role, create an application, create a queue and exchange, and send and receive queue messages, and send messages to an exchange.

== Assign User Permissions

You can use Anypoint Platform to assign user permissions to yourself for use with MQ. These permissions let you create client applications, and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use this same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Users*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-users.png[mq-tut-gear-and-users]
+
. Click your username value:
+
image:mq-tut-click-username.png[mq-tut-click-username]
+
. Click *MQ* and click the green box to set an environment and permissions:
+
image:mq-tut-users-mq.png[mq-tut-users-mq]
+
. After you click the green box, the field changes to *+ Add an environment by name*. Click the plus sign *+* and in the drop-down menu, click *Production* as shown in this composite illustration:
+
image:mq-tut-env-permissions.png[mq-tut-env-permissions]
+
. Under *Permission(s)*, click *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click *Select All*, `Select Access` changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)* to show which which permissions you chose.
+
image:mq-tut-manager-dests.png[mq-tut-manager-dests]
+
. Click the green checkmark to save your settings: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]
+
A summary list appears:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions-summary.png[mq-tut-permissions-summary]
+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed. For this tutorial, you can leave all as shown.

== Queues

A queue provides a temporary stack for holding messages. Applications
push messages to the queue and other applications consume
the messages. In Anypoint MQ, you can read messages, return the messages
for later viewing, or delete a message. By default, messages return to the
waiting area so other applications can read them. Messages persist until the
time to live (TTL) value expires--by default, a message persists in Anypoint MQ
for 7 days.

Queue and exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and exchange names are limited to 128 characters in length.

=== Create a Queue

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
+
image:mq-tut-mq-taskbar.png[mq-tut-mq-taskbar]
+
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-label.png[image:mq-destinations-label]
+
. As shown in the following animation, click the blue plus circle, click
*Queue*, type `MyDemoQueue` for the queue ID, and click *Save Changes*.
After the queue creates, the detail screen appears for the queue. If
the details don't appear, click the right side of the queue entry.
+
image:mq-create-queue.gif[Create queue animated gif]
+
*Note*: Where you click on a queue entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-entryui.png[mq-entryui]

=== How Do I Delete a Queue?

To delete a queue:

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the queue entry in the Destinations table:
+
image:mq-click-type-q.png[mq-click-type-q]
+
. Click the trash can symbol in the upper right.
. In the Delete Queue menu, click the checkbox:
+
image:mq-delete-queue.png[mq-delete-queue]
+
. Click *Delete Queue*.

*Note*: The time it takes to delete or purge a queue is approximately one minute. During this time, the status of the affected queue may not be updated.

=== Send a Message to a Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the MyDemoQueue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the queue name in the details to open the Messaging feature:
+
image:mq-access-messaging.png[mq-access-messaging]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-sender.png[mq-click-msg-sender]
+
. Type text in the *Payload* such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image:mq-msg-sender-text-payload.png[mq-msg-sender-text-payload]
+
. Click *Send*.

=== Verify the Message in a Queue

To verify that the message arrived in the queue:

. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-click-destinations.png[mq-click-destinations, width="173"]
+
. Click the right side of the queue entry to view details and see the number of messages in the queue
as shown in this animation:
+
image:mq-view-details.gif[view queue details animated gif]

=== Get a Message From a Queue

To get a message from a queue:

. Follow the directions in <<Send a Message to a Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser.png[mq-click-msg-browser]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
image:mq-get-messages.png[mq-get-messages]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id.png[mq-click-id]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, such as if other applications may also want to read
the message, click the *Return Messages* icon - this is the default condition. If you switch screens back
to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the message is available
before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image:mq-click-retmsgs.png[mq-click-retmsgs,width="75"]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. In Anypoint MQ, deleting a message is called an `ack`:
+
image:mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon.png[mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon, width="393"]

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

=== Send a CSV or JSON Message

To send a JSON message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:
+
image:mq-json-get-msg.png[mq-json-get-msg]

To send a CSV message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,code]
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message.

== Configure Anypoint Studio for MQ

In this section, we use link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] to create a simple application that you can use
to publish a message to a queue, or to consume the message, and to ack and nack the message.

In the next section, we return to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and register an application that we can use in Studio.

[NOTE]
====
The Studio screens that follow use the new Anypoint Studio Light Theme appearance option which is the default style for Studio 6 (in beta) and newer. You can set this theme in older versions of Studio by clicking *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences* > *General* > *Appearance* > *Theme* > *Studio Light Theme (Beta)*.

image:mq-theme.png[MQ set the appearance theme]

== Test Your Application

Get a REST plugin for your browser so that you can send POST requests. Typical software:

* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb[Simple REST Client for Chrome].
* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman for Chrome].
* link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient[RESTClient for Firefox].
* link:http://www.telerik.com/fiddler[Fiddler for Windows].

The following is an example setup using Postman:

image:mq-post.png[mq-post]

To set up Postman for a REST POST:

. Specify the URL to send the message as `0.0.0.0:8081/mq/Hello`. You can also specify messages with spaces such as,
`0.0.0.0:8081/mq/My What A Great Message`.
. Click *POST* in the drop-down options menu.
. Click *Send* to post the message. You can send more than one message if you prefer.
. View the resulting reply from the Anypoint Studio web server.

=== Viewing Your Message in Anypoint MQ

To view your message:

. Switch back to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], and if needed, log in and click *MQ* in the task bar at the top of the screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the right side to view the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-messages-in-queue.png[mq-messages-in-queue]
+
You can see the number of messages in the queue. Having verified that you have messages, we can now view them.
+
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the start of the entry to view the Queue Settings, Message Sender, and Message Browser.
+
image:mq-view-mydemoq-settings.png[mq-view-mydemoq-settings]
+
. Click *Message Browser* and click *Get Messages*:
+
image:mq-get-messages.png[mq-get-messages]
+
. Click a message ID and view the message to the right.
+
image:mq-click-id-to-see-msg.png[mq-click-id-to-see-msg]

You can repeat this process by returning to your REST POST application and sending and viewing more messages.
In the next section, we build on your knowledge, first with an administrative task of creating user roles and then creating and testing exchanges, which let you send one message to multiple queues.

[[advancedmq]]
== Advanced MQ - Roles and Exchanges

Now that you can send and receive messages, you can learn how to use the additional features Anypoint MQ provides.

* <<Create an Admin Role>> - Explains how to create roles to assign access permissions to Anypoint MQ.
* <<Exchanges>> - Explains how you can use exchanges to send one message to multiple queues.

=== Create an Admin Role

You can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete this tutorial, when you use MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create
roles for all those in your organization who use MQ. After the previous section where you assigned permissions to yourself,
the steps to create a role are very similar and this exercise takes little extra time now and benefits you later.

Creating a role lets you assign access rights to users in your organization, such as for administrators, developers, or for those who only view information but don't change it.

In this tutorial, we grant all permissions to the `MQ Admin` role. When you create other roles for your organization, you can change the permissions as required.

To assign role permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Roles*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-roles.png[mq-tut-gear-and-roles]
+
. Click *Add role*.
+
image:mq-tut-add-role-for-admin.png[mq-add-role-for-admin]
+
. Specify an administrator's role for those who create client apps, queues, and exchanges.
. Click *Add role*.
. Click the Role name and click *MQ*.
. Click the green bar, click the plus sign for *Add an environment by name*, and choose the *Production* environment.
+
image:mq-tut-set-role-env.png[mq-tut-set-role-env]
+
. Click *Permission(s)* > *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click Select All, Select Access, changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)*:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions.png[mq-tut-permissions]
+
. Click the green checkmark on the right to save your changes: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]

=== Exchanges

The sections that follow help you work with Anypoint MQ Exchanges. An exchange
consists of a collection of one or more queues. Exchanges help you organize
queues and send one message to all its bound queues. You can still send and
receive messages from a bound queue, but the exchange ensures all queues
get the same message.

Exchange and queue names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Exchange and queue names are limited to 128 characters in length.

==== Create an Exchange

To create an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Exchange*.
+
image:mq-create-demo-exchange.png[mq-create-demo-exchange, width="325"]
+
. Specify the name `MyDemoExchange`.
. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this exchange.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen. click the exchange *Type* to list its details.

==== Bind a Queue to an Exchange

To bind a queue to an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the left side of the exchange entry in Destinations.
+
*Note*: Where you click on an exchange entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-where-to-click-x.png[mq-where-to-click-x]
+
. In the Exchange menu, click *Bind* for each queue you want to bind to the exchange:
+
image:mq-bind-queue-to-exchange.png[mq-bind-queue-to-exchange]

==== How Do I Delete an Exchange?

To delete an exchange:

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the exchange entry in the Destinations table:
+
image:mq-click-type-x.png[mq-click-type-x]
+
. Click the trash can symbol in the upper right.
. In the Delete Exchange menu, click the checkbox:
+
image:mq-delete-exchange.png[mq-delete-exchange]
+
. Click *Delete Exchange*.

==== Send a Message to an Exchange

Sending a message to an exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to an exchange.

To send a message to an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MyDemoExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the exchange.
. Click the *MyDemoExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-access.png[mq-exchange-msg-access]
+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-sender.png[mq-exchange-msg-sender]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image:mq-exchange-payload.png[mq-exchange-payload]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
