= Anypoint MQ Queues and Exchanges
:keywords: mq, destinations, queues, exchanges, client application

Anypoint MQ is a messaging broker that lets applications communicate by publishing a Mule Message to a queue so that another application can consume the message.

This guide describes how to create a queue, exchange, and client application using Anypoint Platform.

*Note*: Queue and exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and exchange names are limited to 128 characters in length.


== Create a Queue

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.

+
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-label.png[mq-destinations-label, width="177"]
+
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Queue*.
+
In the *Create Queue* window:
+
image:mq-create-demo-queue.png[mq-create-demo-queue, width="400"]
+
.. Specify a name.
+
NOTE: MQ queue names can contain these characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), and hyphen (-). Queue names cannot contain spaces or other characters, and can be up to 127 characters in length.
+
.. (Optional) Change the time-to-live (TTL) durations for:
*** Default Message TTL - How long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted.
*** Default Lock TTL - If there is a server failure and a message is not acknowledged, specifies the duration that a message would wait before being put back into the queue.
+
The duration for each TTL can be from milliseconds up to 14 days.
.. (Optional) Set the queue to encrypted. Anypoint MQ uses PBE with MD5 and triple DES to encrypt messages.
.. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen, click the queue name to list its details:

The next section describes how Anypoint Platform lets you send
messages to a queue and view, return the messages to the queue, or delete the messages.
Message content (called a payload) can be text, JSON, or CSV (comma-separated values).

=== Send a Message to a Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the queue name in the details to open the Messaging feature:
+

image:mq-click-msg-sender.png[mq-click-msg-sender]
+
. Type text in the *Payload* such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+

+
. Click *Send*.

=== Verify the Message in a Queue

=== Get a Message From a Queue

To get a message from a queue:

. Follow the directions in <<Send a Message to the Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser.png[mq-click-msg-browser]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
image:mq-get-messages.png[mq-get-messages]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id.png[mq-click-id]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, such as if other applications
may also want to read the message, click the *Return Messages* icon - this
is the default condition. If you switch screens back to the Message Sender
or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known
as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue
determines how long the message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+

+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. In Anypoint MQ, deleting a message is called an `ack`:

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
