== Noteworthy Improvements

==== Mule Management Console

The following list details the improvements to the *Mule Management Console*.

* Mule applies *versions to applications* when deployed on the Mule Management Console.
* The Mule Management Console offers an improved *application deployment status*.
* The Mule Management Console presents a screen in which a user can determine, at a glance, the deployment location and status of each application (including deployed apps that are, in fact, not in the target server).
* Mule Management Console includes information about deployment operations in the Audit Logs.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule ESB 3.3.2 does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule ESB 3.3.1.

Please mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.
