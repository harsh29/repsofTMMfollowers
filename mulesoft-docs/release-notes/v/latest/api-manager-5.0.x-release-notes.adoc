= API Manager 5.0.X Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, api manager


December 9, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the latest release of link:/documentation/display/current/API+Manager[API Manager], a multitenant service and API registry/repository and governance tool, part of the link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Platform+for+APIs+previous+release[Anypoint Platform for APIs previous release]. API Manager replaces and expands upon the offering formerly known as Anypoint Service Registry.

== Document Revision History

*December 9, 2013*, v.1.0 initial publication.

*January 10, 2014*, v2.0 update to reflect *Agent 5.0.1*, which includes <<Fixed in this Release>>. (Agent 5.0.1 is automatically embedded in the Mule 3.4.2 runtime and is applied to the the December 2013 runtime available on CloudHub.) 

*March 16, 2014*, v3.0 update to reflect Agent 5.0.2, which introduces significant new features and upgraded functionality for users deploying to the *3.5.0-M4 Runtime*, which is an *early-access release*. Agent 5.0.2 is included in Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access) and the 3.5.0-M4 Enterprise standalone runtime. 

== New Features and Functionality

*Version 5.0.2* of the API Manager agent introduced the following new features and upgraded functionality:

* *New OAuth 2.0 Provider and Token Validation Policies *: These two new policies allow service owners to set up authorized access via OAuth for all four major gr1ant types, backed by a security manager.
* *New Throttling and Rate Limiting Policies with Consumer Key Enforcement*: Two new policy templates, Throttling - Consumer Key-Based and Rate Limiting - Consumer Key-Based, allow service owners to throttle and rate limit access to service versions and endpoints using consumer keys to enforce the limits.
* *Improved Endpoint Aliasing on CloudHub*: Auto-registration of endpoints via CloudHub now automatically registers the unique CloudHub domain name to API Manager for better usability and tracking.
* *Backward Compatibility:* Older versions of the API Manager agent running on Mule ESB versions 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0, 3.4.1, and 3.4.2 will continue to work without any action on behalf of users.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that these new policies and features described above are available for use only with services and APIs deployed or proxied with the *Mule* *3.5.0-M4 Enterprise Runtime (Early Access)*. For any APIs or services registered in API Manager for production use, please refer to the minimum supported runtime column in this table to ensure that the policies that you are applying are supported in the runtime you are using.

*Version 5.0.1* of the API Manager agent did not introduce new features.

*Version 5.0.0* of the API Manager agent introduced the following new features and upgraded functionality:

* *New name and URLs*: The product formerly known as Anypoint Service Registry has been rolled up into a new offering as part of the larger Anypoint Platform for APIs. As a result, the web application is now available at http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/api-platform.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Service+Management#ServiceManagement-EndpointAliasing[Endpoint Aliasing]:* You can now define aliases to manage your endpoints through a load balancer or proxy. Aliasing also allows you to manage multiple localhost endpoints with the same name in your organization.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/LDAP+Security+Manager+previous+release[New LDAP-Backed Basic Authentication]:* New organizations created after the 5.0.0 release have access to an LDAP security policy, which allows you to set up basic authentication using an LDAP or Active Directory.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Policy+Templates[New Consumer Key Enforcement]* : New organizations created after the 5.0.0 release have access to a new policy: Contract Enforcement - Consumer Key-Based, which allows service owners to limit access to service versions and endpoints using consumer keys.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/API+Manager+System+Architecture[Asynchronous API Manager Agent Communication]:* The API Manager agent has been refactored to communicate asynchronously with API Manager for non-blocking transparency and performance improvement.
*  *Backward Compatibility:* Older versions of the API Manager agent running on Mule ESB versions 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0, and 3.4.1 will continue to work without any action on behalf of users.

|===
|JIRA |Issue |Workaround
|STUDIO-3800 |Validation error when creating a global element for service auto discovery if serviceName attribute contains spaces |Enter serviceName attribute without spaces, then edit the name via the registry console or API after registration.
|HABITAT-247 |Once SLA tiers are defined for a service, the registry does not permit contracts unless a tier is selected. |Service owner can delete existing tiers, allow the contract to be requested while no tiers are defined, and then reinstate the tiers after the contract request has been made. Any contracts that were based on the tiers before their deletion will not be affected.
|HABITAT-333 a|
The registry does not recognize endpoints of http proxies using `inboundAddress` and `outboundAddress` elements.

 a|
Define a proxy using the following method:

|HABITAT-932 |Dynamic lookup invokes outbound endpoints using factory defaults; no customization or override of the defaults is possible. |None at this time. However, note that all HTTP outbound endpoints will be invoked using the POST method (which is the default for the HTTP protocol) and that overriding with a GET method is not currently supported.
|HABITAT-960 |Analytics incorrectly reports http requests received via a browser. |Calling endpoints via Postman, for example, results in correct tracking.
|HABITAT-999 |Search cannot find services and consumers if name contains "-". |Omit special characters in the search tool.
|HABITAT-1037 |When creating contract-based throttling or rate-limiting policy, contract expression is shown and editable. |Do not edit the contract expression in this window. Instead, set the contract expression only on the contract enforcement policy.
|HABITAT-1039 |Studio throws an error when you specify a <sr:service> global element without referencing it via <sr:auto-register-as>. |Comment out any auto-register-as global element configurations in your applications while they are not referenced in any endpoints.
|HABITAT-1056 |Rate Limiting Policy cannot be removed once the max limit of calls is performed. |Wait until the time period for the max limit expires, then unapply the policy.
|HABITAT-1058 |When changing the name of a service/consumer using invalid characters, there is no error message. | 
|HABITAT-1068 |When a policy is applied at endpoint level, if the endpoint is deleted, policy characteristics displayed on service panel are not updated. | 
|HABITAT-1154 |On Internet Explorer, deleting a policy takes more than one minute. | 
|HABITAT-1159 |Contract-based policies should not show the default contract expression on the API. | 
|HABITAT-1162 |Autodiscovery exception thrown if application has no endpoints associated to a service. | 
|HABITAT-1164 |Dynamic lookup limited to tracked endpoints; does not include aliases. | 
|HABITAT-1176 |Incorrect security provider applied when switching provider policies within the same operation. |Unapply a security provider policy, hit the endpoint, then apply the new security provider policy.
|HABITAT-1198 |On a service, if localhost:8081 is already defined, system does not allow a new endpoint creation using it even if an alias is provided.  | 
|HABITAT-1203 |When calling working but not yet tracked endpoint, stacktrace is generated. | 
|HABITAT-1204 |Applying and unapplying rate limit policy does not clear correctly policy rate limit values.  | 
|HABITAT-1207 |When declaring a service without endpoints using autodiscovery, no endpoint is tracked.  | 
|HABITAT-1223 |On Service details, infinite applying animation is displayed when applying twice a nested policy.  | 
|HABITAT-1230 |Consumer Key based policy can be applied when contract enforcement by contract key is used. | 
|HABITAT-1231 |On consumers, after revoking a contract, page is not refreshed.  | 
|HABITAT-1232 |On service, service details, it is not possible to revoke a contract. |Revoke contract from Contracts screen.
|HABITAT-1233 |When creating a service, some of the declared endpoints are discarded. |After exiting the service creation wizard, add additional endpoints as needed.

== Migration Guide

There are no specific migration activities if you are migrating from Anypoint Service Registry 4.0.0 to API Manager 5.0.X.

Migrating from older versions

[NOTE]
====
If you have services registered on API Manager with an link:/documentation/display/current/API+Manager+Agent+Compatibility+Matrix[agent versions 117, 119, or 2.11.1] and migrate to the CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013) with the 5.0.X Anypoint Service Registry agent, please be aware that within the element `<service-lookup>`, the attribute `serviceName` has changed to `serviceId`. Please update your consumer applications that are performing dynamic lookup and replace any instances of `serviceName` with `serviceId`.

In addition, the attribute `serviceRoundRobin` has been removed and replaced with a new element: `<dynamic-round-robin>`. Please update your consumer applications that were performing dynamic lookup to delete any references to the deprecated attribute. To enable round robin routing strategy, use the new <`dynamic-round-robin`> element instead.
