:keywords: release notes, esb

The Mule team is proud to announce the availability of Mule ESB 3.2.1. This is a follow-up release to link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.2.0-release-notes[Mule ESB 3.2.0], which continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, complete, and up-to-date enterprise ESB solution.

== New in Mule ESB Version 3.2.1

* Improved cluster performance
* Enhanced Business Events search usability
** Custom event details are displayed in-line for improved readability
** Processing times are now available for out-bound endpoints

== Limitations

* Currently, Mule HA Clusters support a maximum of 4 nodes per cluster
* Each node within a Mule cluster is intended to run on a separate physical/virtual machine
* Currently, the Until-Successful router retries an operation until the operation succeeds; however, all retry attempts occur on just one node in the cluster

== Known Issues

* The Mule ESB Enterprise Edition trial software cannot be used as a cluster node if you are also using it to evaluate the management console. Mulesoft recommends that you install the management console in a web container such as Apache Tomcat whenever you wish to manage cluster nodes
* Currently, if two nodes of a four-node cluster go down simultaneously, the possibility of message loss arises. This issue is scheduled for resolution in a future release.
* Due to a bug in ActiveMQ, whenever a transactional endpoint requests an event more than one time from within the same transaction, the second request always returns "null", if no timeout is used, or it causes the application to hang.
* This release does not support HP-UX.
* On occasion, when a cluster is first started it may take up to 30 minutes for all of the required backup memory partition's to be assigned and active. The state of your backup partition's can be identified by looking in the logs of any mule instance in the cluster. In cases where this delay occurs, only one partition will be without a backup for this period of time. It is recommended you monitor for this when first starting your cluster in production.

== Migration

The "tracking" directory containing data files for the Business Event Analyzer is now placed in the mmc-data directory. If you have been using the Business Event Analyzer with the default database you will need to move the directory called "tracking" into the mmc-data directory. The mmc-data and tracking directories can be found in the working directory of the container running the management console, or under the .mule directory if you are using the trial Mule ESB enterprise edition bundle. Note: if you are using Oracle to store Business Event Analyzer data then no action need be taken.

For further information on migrating from Mule 3.1.x to 3.2 see the Migration Guide

The following JIRAs are open against this release of Mule ESB:
