== SAP Connector 2.2.8 - January 28, 2016

[[sap-connector-228-compatibility]]
=== Version 2.2.8 Compatibility

The MuleSoft Enterprise Java Connector for SAP connector is compatible with:

|===
|Application/Service|Version

|Mule Runtime|3.5.x or higher
|SAP R/3|Release 3.1 or higher
|SAP ERP|6.0 EhP 7 (SAP_APPL 607) or higher
|Java|1.7.0_x
|Anypoint Studio|5.x
|===

[[sap-connector-228-features]]
=== Version 2.2.8 Features

* Transaction ID (TID) has been added as a property of the Mule Message. Thus, when sending or receiving IDocs, the user will be able to call RFC-enabled Function Modules on SAP (`INBOUND_IDOCS_FOR_TID` and `OUTBOUND_IDOCS_FOR_TID`) to retrieve the IDoc number.

[[sap-connector-228-fixes]]
=== Version 2.2.8 Fixes

* Java's UTF-8 encoding had not been recognizing initial character BOM (Byte Order Marker).

* Metadata retrieval in DataSense for BAPI names containing slashes ("/"), e.g. "/DSD/ME_GETLIST_TR", is fixed.

[[sap-connector-228-known-issues]]
=== Version 2.2.8 Known Issues

* Destination Provider reference gets lost after hot redeploy of an application (i.e. modifying the mule-config.xml)

[[sap-connector-227]]
== SAP Connector 2.2.7 - July 1, 2015

[[sap-connector-227-compatibility]]
=== Version 2.2.7 Compatibility

The MuleSoft Enterprise Java Connector for SAP connector is compatible with:

|===
|Application/Service|Version

|Mule Runtime|3.5.x or higher
|SAP R/3|Release 3.1 or higher
|SAP ERP|6.0 EhP 7 (SAP_APPL 607) or higher
|Java|1.7.0_x

[[sap-connector-227-features]]
=== Version 2.2.7 Features

* None

[[sap-connector-227-fixes]]
=== Version 2.2.7 Fixes

* Compatibility issue with Anypoint Studio 5.2: when making a BAPI call or sending an IDoc, the SAP outbound endpoint could not parse an XML input built with a DataWeave Message Transformer.

* XML version 2 parser displayed confusing ERROR messages expected when defining the record type.

* The "MINIMAL" metadata mode now generates sample rows for tables.

[[sap-connector-227-known-issues]]
=== Version 2.2.7 Known Issues

* Destination Provider reference gets lost after hot-redeploy of an application (i.e. modifiying the mule-config.xml)

[[sap-connector-226]]
== SAP Connector 2.2.6 - June 17, 2015

[[sap-connector-226-compatibility]]
=== Version 2.2.6 Compatibility

The MuleSoft Enterprise Java Connector for SAP connector is compatible with:

|===
|Application/Service|Version

|Mule Runtime|3.5.x or higher
|SAP R/3|Release 3.1 or higher
|SAP ERP|6.0 EhP 7 (SAP_APPL 607) or higher
|Java|1.7.0_x
|Anypoint Studio|5.x
|===

[[sap-connector-226-features]]
=== Version 2.2.6 Features

* Added demo examples to public site, available for download at http://mulesoft.github.io/sap-transport/

* Extended multi-tenancy support to all the connection parameters (jcoAsHost, jcoUser, jcoLang, jcoClient, jcoPasswd & jcoSysnr) so that the connections can be defined dynamically in runtime. This way, the connector can now be used in real multi-tenant scenarios within Data Gateway.

* Set the correct mimeType for payload to each message created by the SAP Transport in order to be fully compatible with the new Data Framework.

[[sap-connector-226-fixes]]
=== Version 2.2.6 Fixes

* Operation timeout cannot be configured for SAP Inbound Endpoint.

* XML definition not removed from config file after deletion from Studio GUI.

* NullPointerException when using Scallable Node Controller (SNC) and the password attribute is null. The SNC connection mode uses digital certificates to execute the authentication and hence no username and password are required.

* Defective IDoc to XML conversion after upgrading to SAPJCo 3.0.13 and SAPidoc 3.0.12.

[[sap-connector-226-known-issues]]
=== Version 2.2.6 Known Issues
