:keywords: release notes, anypoint studio


October 4, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule Studio (October 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013)**.

Our new version of Studio functions as a single download with two runtimes:

* Mule 3.4.1 Enterprise Runtime - available for deployment on premises and to CloudHub
* CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013) - available for deployment to CloudHub

These release notes apply to Mule Studio (October 2013) and the CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013). Note that the new features and functionality described here are only available for deployment in CloudHub using the CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013). If you intend to deploy your application to an on-premise production server, use a Mule 3.4.1 runtime when you begin a new project in Mule Studio. Access link:/documentation/display/34X/Home[Mule 3.4 documentation] for details. 
[TIP]
Refer to our Release Strategy for full details about our most recently released runtimes and their deployment options.

== Migrating from Mule Studio Andes to Mule Studio (October 2013)

[NOTE]
It is recommended that you create a **new workspace in Mule Studio (October 2013)**, then import any existing projects into your new workspace.

* With Mule Studio October 2013, the ObjectStore interface adds a new clear() method that empties the contents of an object store without disposing of it. In case of persistent object store, the actual files backing the content are deleted. In case of transient object stores, the reference to the items are severed. The ObjectStoreManager's dispose() method should first delegate into the store's clear method and then dispose() it if necessary.
* With Mule Studio October 2013, the QueueManager interface includes a clear() method that empties the queue. In case of persistent object store, the actual files backing the content are deleted. In case of transient object stores, the reference to the items will be severed. ObjectStoreManager's dispose() method should first delegate into the store's clear method and then dispose() it if necessary.

For more details on how to migrate from previous versions of Mule Studio, access the migration guide embedded within the release notes for previous versions of Mule, or the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[library of legacy Migration Guides].

== Third Party Extensions

At this time, not all of the third party extensions you may have been using with previous versions of Mule ESB have been upgraded to work with Mule Studio (October 2013). mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific module.
