MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of *Anypoint Enterprise Security 1.2* which introduces new functionality and improvements to our versatile security module (formerly known as Mule Enterprise Security). For this release, we have focused our efforts bug fixes and improvements.  We also continue to harden our product, making it more stable and easier to use. 

Where appropriate, we have applied a *_Version 1.2 only_* marker to identify features or functionality that are available only in the Enterprise runtime.

== New Features and Functionality

* *Delete Client* – a message processor which removes clientIDs from the clientStore. 
* *Revoke Token* –  a message processor which revokes access or refresh tokens, invalidating the corresponding pair as well (i.e. if the message processor revokes the access token, it automatically revokes any refresh token associated with it, and vice versa). 
* *Use with Mule ESB Standalone and Maven* – beyond Mule Studio, Anypoint Enterprise Security is now available for use with Mule Standalone and Maven. +


== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Enterprise Security 1.2 does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule Enterprise Security 1.1.   Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.
