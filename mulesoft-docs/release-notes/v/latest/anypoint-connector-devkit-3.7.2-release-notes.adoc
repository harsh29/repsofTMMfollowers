= Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.7.2 Release Notes

== New Features

* Adds a new connector category called Certified for MuleSoft Certified connectors.
* Connector Testing Framework (CTF) makes sure the targeted Mule application is running on CloudHub before it starts testing the connector.

== Fixed Issues

This release includes several fixes, and the most important ones are:

* Supports the OAuth callback for the latest HTTP Connector.
* Doesn’t generate a global element (connector:config) when a connector is built without @Configurable annotation.
* Mule context was not properly attached when “Test Connection” was executed, but this version injects Mule context properly when @TestConnectivity is called.
* Resolves an exception error when MetaData is tested in CTF.
