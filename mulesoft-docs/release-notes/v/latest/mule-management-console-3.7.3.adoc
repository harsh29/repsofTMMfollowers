:keywords: release notes, mmc mule management console

The Mule Management Console, also known as MMC, is a platform for managing Mule applications deployed on premises. Most of its functionality is being replaced by the Anypoint Runtime Manager, which is available both on premises and in the cloud (accessible via the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub]) link. Moving forward, MMC will be deprecated and the Anypoint Runtime Manager alone will be updated.
No new functionality is being added to the MMC, this release includes only bug fixes and security fixes.
