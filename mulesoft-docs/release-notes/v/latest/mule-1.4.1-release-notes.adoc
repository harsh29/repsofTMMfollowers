= Mule 1.4.1 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb


The Mule Team are pleased to announce the release of version 1.4.1. This is a maintenance release that sees over 70 reported issues closed. The highlights of this release are -

* The JCA resource archives can be customized for different App. Server needs where the generic .rar does not suffice. Currently we publish a customized .rar for JBoss.
* Streaming support for the FTP transport. Note that Streaming is still in Beta and only supports simple streaming use cases.
* Soap (Axis) over JMS now supports transactions.
* ExceptionStrategy has been improved to reduce the noise when reporting to the log file (often Stack traces were being duplicated)
* Upgrades of various dependencies for modules and transports.

As always, many thanks to our community for submitting bug reports, patches and improvements to Mule.
