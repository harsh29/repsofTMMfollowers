= Migrating Mule 3.1 to 3.2
:keywords: release notes, esb


== Java Runtime Level

Starting with Mule 3.2.0, Java 6 is required for both to build and to run Mule. User and third-party JARs compiled with earlier versions of Java will continue to work with Mule.

== Maven Level

Starting with Mule 3.2.0, http://maven.apache.org/download.html[Maven version 3] is required to build Mule.

=== Acegi Module

The Acegi module is superseded by the Spring security module and has been deprecated. Starting with Mule 3.2, the Acegi module is no longer contained in any Mule distribution. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/upgrading-from-acegi-to-spring-security[Upgrading from Acegi to Spring Security] for details on migrating the security module.

== Configuration Changes

The syntax for grouping message processors and calling flows has been clarified:

* <processor-chain> should be used only to group message processors within other constructs such as routers. Globally configured processor-chains are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* <sub-flow> has been introduced to represent a globally configured group of message processors that will be called synchronously through <flow-ref>.
* Flows, when called using <flow-ref>, follow their specified processing strategy. If not specified, the processing strategy defaults to `asynchronous-queued`. This is a change from previous behavior, in which flows were processed synchronously if called using <flow-ref>. In order to have the private flows behaving synchronously by default, as they did in previous versions, they have to be redefined as sub-flows
* <flow> no longer takes a threading-profile as a child element. Use <processing-strategy> instead.

== Behavior Changes

As described in <<Configuration Changes>>, <flow-ref> no longer forces synchronous processing of the referenced flow. To get synchronous behavior, either specify `processingStrategy="synchronous"` on the target flow or use a sub-flow.

== API Changes

* The `org.mule.construct.SimpleFlowConstruct` class has been renamed to `org.mule.construct.Flow`.
* The `org.mule.exception.DefaultServiceExceptionStrategy` class has been split into these new classes: `org.mule.exception.DefaultMessagingExceptionStrategy` and `org.mule.exception.DefaultSystemExceptionStrategy`
* The `org.mule.module.pgp.LazyInputStream` class has been renamed to `org.mule.module.pgp.LazyTransformedInputStream`
* The `org.mule.module.pgp.OutputStreamWriter` class has been renamed to `org.mule.module.pgp.StreamTransformer`

== Schema Changes

=== Schema Location Changes

The version that should be used in schema locations is **3.2**. Starting with this version, you can also use *current* â€“ this should simplify moving from a legacy version of Mule to a newer one.

[NOTE]
The *current* schema location will be resolved to the schema bundled locally in the Mule ESB runtime in which the application is running.
