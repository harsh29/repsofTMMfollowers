Recent work includes the following areas:

*Hot Deployment* - Mule now supports multiple applications running within the same Mule instance and deployment descriptors for specifying the contents of your deployment (e.g., multiple configuration files). All Mule examples included in the distribution have now been updated to use the new application deployment format. If you have not yet read about the application deployment model new to Mule 3.0, read this http://blogs.mulesoft.org/mule-3-rebooted/[blog post].

*Message Exchange Patterns* - Message Exchange Patterns (a.k.a. MEPs) give you more explicit and flexible control over the way messages flow through Mule. For example, you can now specify whether you expect a response on a given endpoint or not (see the new attribute "exchange-pattern" on endpoints). In the future, we may introduce additional exchange patterns that allow for different communication styles as well.

*Message Processor API* - An architectural change to simplify Mule's internals and give it the flexibility to implement other patterns in the future which align more closely to specific scenarios beyond the <service>/<component> elements which you all know and love.

*Message Property Scoping* - Message properties are now scoped in either `inbound`, `invocation` or `outbound` scope. These scopes provide isolation and consistency to the way properties are attached to inbound and outbound messages.

*Lifecycle Improvements* - Improves behaviour during startup and shutdown of applications, a very important aspect of hot deployment.

=== Migration
