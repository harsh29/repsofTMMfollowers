== April 2016 Release

Prior to this release, MuleSoft offered API Entitlements on a contract basis, but did not restrict access to the related features. Features are currently being used by those who often have no knowledge of the purchase requirement. In this release, the features will continue to be available to customers who started using the features earlier.

If you have not purchased API Entitlements and are _not_ a continuing user, these changes are effective on Anypoint Platform:

* The controls for deploying an API to CloudHub do not appear.
* Analytics and controls for deploying a proxy, listing applications, setting up SLAs, applying policies, and changing permissions do not appear on the API version page.

If you have _not_ purchased API Entitlements and are _not_ a continuing user, the API version page looks something like this:

If you have purchased API Entitlements, you see more controls and analytics on the page. The API version page looks something like this:

=== Enhancements and Bug Fixes

This release includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

*Enhancements*

* UI redesign
+
The user interface has a new look, designed for easier use.
+
* Policies numbers show order of application
+
In addition to listing applied policies in the order that you apply them, Anypoint Platform now includes the order number.
* Improved audit log detail
+
The audit log now reveals the permission level of the users when you assign a permission to a user.

*Bug Fixes*

* A tooltip is now displayed when the full API name is truncated in the UI.
* The problem related to resetting the client secret when using Internet Explorer 11 has been resolved.
* A list of grant types are now displayed in the application sidebar.
* An example or default value that you set in the RAML is no longer hidden in the console.
* The API Designer is no longer overriding example files. The import process now overrides example files when configured to do so.

== January 2016 Release

This release includes the following new features and functionality:

* Redesign of API management page which now makes more information available at a glance and provides a drop-down API version menu for easier access. The analytics panel has been removed, providing more space for the display of API management-related information. To access, you can use the navigation menu towards the top and right of the page.
* New applications management page, the single point of access for all client applications for an organization’s APIs. Explore and manage your client applications from here. To reach it you can use the navigation menu towards the top and right of the API management page.
* From the applications management page, clients can now add or remove owners of an application. This feature makes it
easier to keep information about applications up to date.
* Gateway Awareness and Policy Ordering. Policy configuration is now aware for the set of policies supported by the Gateway tracking your API proxy. Because of this, unsupported policies are not available to be applied, and applied policies that are not supported by the tracking gateway are highlighted so that you can easily detect and correct problems.

There are no new known issues or any changes that impact compatibility or that require migration considerations.

== November 2015 Release

This release has the following updates:

* IP whitelisting and blacklisting policies provide the option to specify a comma-separated list of IPs for bulk edits.
* API owners can modify the configuration of a policy without having to add or remove the policy every time
* Ability to select an API Gateway Cluster as the target of deployment from the API platform proxy auto-deployment window.

This release includes selected limitations that you need to be aware of as you create new organizations and populate them with your API metadata.

=== Known Issues in the July 2014 Release

==== Localhost Behavior

Note that defining an endpoint using localhost has important behavior implications for on-premises deployments of APIs and proxies. Refer to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/localhost-behavior-on-the-api-gateway[Localhost Behavior on the API Gateway] for details.

==== Limitations

* The REST APIs for the Anypoint Platform for APIs are not currently exposed publicly for customer use.
* It is not possible to visit the Developer Portal or any public API Portals when signed in as a user of a different organization.
* Developers cannot currently revoke their contracts with API Versions, only API Version Owners have the ability to revoke and delete contracts.
* API Portals cannot currently be deleted.
* Throttling and Rate Limiting policies do not currently work for APIs or proxies deployed to multiple API Gateway workers in CloudHub.
* It is only possible to register new applications from a portal for a specific API version rather than globally from the main Developer Portal page.
* Batch approval of applications is not currently supported.
* Copying content from one API Version to another is not currently supported.
* The IP whitelisting and IP blacklisting policies do not function for endpoints defined with the Jetty transport.
* Session timeouts occur after a three-hour window irrespective of user activity.

==== Key Differences for Users Migrating from Previous Versions

If you have an existing Anypoint Platform for APIs account on a previous version, you need to migrate to this version during the migration period. Be aware of the following major differences between the previous versions and the July 2014 release:

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-for-apis-glossary[Terminology] has changed to standardize around APIs and applications rather than services and consumers.
* Each API version now has only a single endpoint. 
* The administrative view of your API version (called the API Version Details page) is now accessible only to API Version Owners or Organization Administrators. The Developer Portal, containing the API Portals that you create and share, now acts as the developer-facing view of your API.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[Policy application] has been streamlined to a single step for each policy. Contract enforcement and related policies have been replaced with client ID and secret enforcement. SLA-based policies now incorporate client ID and secret enforcement automatically.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/browsing-and-accessing-apis[Application management] flows have changed. You can now set SLA tiers for automatic approval to reduce your management overhead. Manual approval is also available.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/viewing-api-analytics[Analytics] are now available only to Organization Administrators.
* Taxonomies, policy characteristic tags, and environments are deprecated.
* API Designer is now accessible through the API Version Details page rather than in the Developer Portal.
