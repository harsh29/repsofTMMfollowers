=== New features:

This release includes an early preview of the new deployment model for Mule applications, check out the http://blogs.mulesoft.org/mule-3-rebooted/[Mule 3. Rebooted] post for details.

This release features a lot of Lifecycle improvements. While this may not affect you directly, the behaviour during startup and shutdown should be much more consistent and failsafe now.

As previously announced in a http://blogs.mulesoft.org/bye-bye-messageadapter-hello-messagefactory/[blog post] we removed the `MuleMessageAdapter` and replaced it with a `MuleMessageFactory`. Regular users should not notice the change but if you're writing your own transports you may want to read about the necessary migration steps.

=== Migration

For further information on migrating from Mule 2.2 to 3.0 see the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[Migration Guide].

=== Feedback

As always but especially with Milestone release please provide all/any feedback on Mule 3 progress via http://www.mulesoft.org/jira/[JIRA] (bugs) .

=== Included bugfixes:

As always, all bug fixes from Mule 2.2.x were ported into this release.
