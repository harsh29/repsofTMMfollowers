= Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime Early Access Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, anypoint studio

March 10, 2014

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of *Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access)*.

Our new version of Anypoint Studio (formerly known as Mule Studio) functions as a single download and includes the 3.5.0-M4 runtime (early access) with an enterprise trial license. Note that the new features and functionality described here are *_not_ intended for deployment in a production environment*. If you intend to deploy your application to CloudHub or an on-premises production server, use a Mule 3.4.X runtime or CloudHub Mule Runtime when you begin a new project in Mule Studio.

Further, these release notes offer some detail on the tangentially released APIkit version 1.2. See <<New Features and Functionality>> section below.

== New Features and Functionality

* *Mule Studio > Anypoint Studio*: New name, same great taste! To better synchronize with our Anypoint Platform, Studio earned a new moniker to fit in with the rest of the crowd.
* *New Database Connector*: This new connector allows you to connect with almost any JDBC relational database, consistently using one same interface for every case. You can run diverse SQL operations on your database, including Select, Insert, Update, Delete, and even Stored Procedures.
* *Deprecation of JDBC endpoint*: With the introduction of the new Database Connector comes the deprecation of its predecessor, the JDBC endpoint. Indicated by a "Deprecated" tag in Studio, the endpoint encourages you to use the new Database Connector in version 3.5.0-M4 and later. 
* *New Web Service Consumer*: This new connector allows you to consume a web service from within your Mule application using information automatically extracted from the service's WSDL using Mule DataSense.
* *Palette Simplification*: In the Studio palette, Endpoints and Cloud Connectors categories have been merged in one category called Connectors.
* *Batch Processing Improvements*: Batch Processing now includes the ability to batch process non-serializable messages, and to stream batch commits. Further, you can now order the execution of batch job instances.
* *Shared Resources*: Need to share connectors and transaction managers between applications? Shared Resources gives you the ability to share configurations between applications and development teams, including the new Database Connector and the new Bitronix transaction manager.
* *Invoke Message Processor*: The Invoke message processor is newly exposed in the Studio interface.
* *Request-Reply Scope*: The Request-Reply scope is newly exposed in the Studio interface.
* *Scatter-Gather*: A routing message processor, Scatter-Gather, sends a request message to multiple targets concurrently. It collects the responses from all routes, and aggregates them into a single message.
* *Support for FIPS 140-2*: Mule now can be configured to run in a FIPS 140-2 certified environment.
* *Synchronous Until-Successful*: New with 3.5.0-M4, you can configure your until-successful scope to process messages synchronously, relative to your main flow. 
* *Anypoint Connector DevKit in Studio*: To build your own Anypoint Connector, you can use the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connector+DevKit[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. In the Early Access release of Anypoint Studio, you can add a module that enables you to access DevKit functionality directly in Studio. Includes New Anypoint Connector wizard to easily create new connector projects.
* *Jetty Acceptor Threads*: Now exposed in Mule, the Jetty acceptor threads enable tuning to handle larger loads, more clients. 
* *Upgraded HA*: We have upgraded the Hazelcast engine underlying Mule's High Availability clustering.
* *XSD Validation Improvements*: We have improved the validation of XSDs in Mule applications, offering better validation and helpful error messages.
* *DataSense Explorer*: This feature surfaces information about the Mule message – payload, variables, and properties – as it passes through your flow, relative to the building block you currently have selected on the canvas.
* *Better Performance with JMS:* Under a high load, use JMS session pooling to obtain better performance. 
* *Performance Improvements in DataMapper and HA:* The architecture of new 3.5.0-M4 components - such as Database Connector, Web Service Consumer, and Scatter-Gather – take into account performance tuning best practices. Use an added Jetty attribute further tune performance. 
* *OAuth 2.0 Out of the Box*: OAuth 2.0 is now bundled with the Mule ESB EE runtime. This means API Manager can now apply an OAuth policy against ESB 3.5.0-M4.
* *link:/release-notes/api-manager-5.0.x-release-notes[API Manager Agent 5.0.2]:* Included in the Early Access release, the new agent version supports the use of four new policies in API Manager, including support for OAuth 2.0 security.
* *APIkit version 1.2:* Released in conjunction with the Early Access release and now included automatically in Studio, the newest version of APIkit includes improved functionality:
** improved user experience using the RAML Editor
** added ability to generate `!include` files from within the RAML Editor
** added ability to open the API Console within the Studio console

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access) does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013). Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Migration Guide

As 3.5.0-M4 is an early access release, it is not recommended for use in a production environment. Thus, it is not recommended to upgrade from a previous general availability release such as Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013), to Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access). 

However, if you wish to import existing projects into an instance of Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access), it is recommended that you create a *new workspace in Anypoint Studio (Early Access)*, then import any existing projects into your new workspace. The following migration guide details apply to users who are importing existing projects into an instance of Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0-M4 Runtime (Early Access), or 3.5.0-M4 Enterprise Runtime (Early Access), or 3.5.0-M4 Community Runtime (Early Access).

|MULE-6968 |In the previous versions of Mule, when no path was defined on an HTTP endpoint, requests sent to "/" were received; if the path was defined as " " or "/", requests were rejected. With 3.5.0-M4, the HTTP endpoint receives requests if no path was defined, or if the path was defined as " " or "/".
|MULE-7013 |The `keepSendSocketOpen` attribute in the HTTP/S connector is deprecated. Inherited from TCP Connector, this has no effect on outbound HTTP connections and will be removed in the future.
|MULE-7023 |The `keep-alive` attribute in inbound and outbound HTTP/S endpoints is renamed to `keepAlive`.
|MULE-7011 |`org.mule.util.queue.Queue` class now has a `clear()` method to discard all elements in the queue while leaving the queue usable. If you have your own implementation of a Mule Queue, be sure to adjust the configuration to take into account this new behavior.
|MULE-7010 |`ObjectStore` class now has a `clear()` method which discards all elements while leaving the store usable. If you have your own implementation of `ObjectStore`, be sure to adjust the configuration to take into account this new behavior.
|MULE-7090 a|
* Mule uses the default security provider and TLSv1 as the default algorithm for secure socket connections.
* `t``lsProtocolHandler` attribute from TLS configuration in SSL, TLS, SMTPS, Jetty HTTPS transports is deprecated and will be ignored. Mule uses the default settings defined in the JVM platform. This parameter is no longer needed in supported JDKs.

|MULE-7061 |Jetty transport now uses Jetty 8. Applications using a custom `jetty.xml` configuration file must update the Jetty classes referenced in this file due to package names changed from version 6 to 7. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Starting/Porting_to_Jetty_7/Packages_and_Classes[Read more for details].
|MULE-7138 |MD5MuleEventKeyGenerator is now deprecated. The new implementation is: SHA256MuleEventKeyGenerator.
|MULE-7097 a|
A new configuration file, `conf/tls-default.conf`, has been added. This file defines two properties:

* limit the cipher suites
* protocols used by Mule in SSL sockets

|MULE-7103 a|
The new system property, `mule.security.model`, may be used to alter the security setup of Mule and its modules.

* If _not_ defined, or defined with the value `default`, no restrictions apply and Mule reads the TLS configuration from the `conf/tls-default.conf` file.
* If defined with the value `fips140-2`, Mule works with a FIPS compliant security model: any cryptographic modes of operation not approved in the standard will be disabled. (The PGP module will be disabled, and the TLS configuration properties will be read from `conf/tls-fips140-2.conf`). Note that full FIPS compliance also requires a certified JCE provider installed.

|MULE-7390 a|
Out of the box, the following transformers no longer support external entities:

* xslt-transformer
* dom-to-xml-transformer
* xml-to-dom-transformer
* dom-to-output-handler-transformer
* xquery-transformer

For cases in which external entities processing is needed, the attribute `acceptExternalEntities` has been added for optional configuration (defaults to a value of `false`). Use this attribute with extreme caution in cases in which you trust the source only.

|EE-3509 |Instead of MD5, the cache module uses SHA-256 as the hashing function.
|n/a |cacheJmsSessions is deprecated.
