** Create Application: Creates an application without deploying a Mule application.
** Create And Deploy Application: Creates and deploys a Mule application.
** Change Notification Status: Changes the status (Read or Unread) of a notification.
** Change Application Status: Changes the status (Start or Stop) of an application.
** Get Notification: Retrieves a notification by their ID.
** Retrieve Application Log: Retrieves the log from an application.
* CloudHub connector as a Source: Added the operation to poll for notifications.
* Deleted the following processors:
** Start application: Migrated to Change Application Status processor.
** Stop application: Migrated to Change Application Status processor.
** Dismiss notification: Migrated to Change Notification Status.
* Modified the following processors:
** Create notification: Now the domain needs to be provided. To have the same behavior for CloudHub instances, use `${domain}` place holder.
** Create tenant: Now the Tenant configuration can only be filled by reference.
** Deploy application: Now only deploys application, and cannot modify anymore CloudHub configuration. To modify a CloudHub configuration, use Update Application.

** List tenants: Now the Tenant configuration can only be filled by reference.
** Update application: Modified to comply with the existing CloudHub API.

=== Version 2.0 - Known Issues

The use of application Domain has become mandatory in many operations. This breaks backwards compatibility with older applications, but it’s due to a CloudHub requirement and cannot be removed.
