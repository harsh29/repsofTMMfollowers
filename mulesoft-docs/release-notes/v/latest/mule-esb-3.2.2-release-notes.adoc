= Mule ESB 3.2.2 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb

We are happy to announce the release of Mule ESB 3.2.2 EE. This is a follow-up to **Mule ESB 3.2.1**, which continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, complete, and up-to-date enterprise ESB solution.

We have been working very hard to resolve issues since 3.2.1, and we fixed over 90 issues for this release, making it the most stable version yet, and a highly recommended upgrade.

We focused on significantly improving ESB reliability by fixing multiple issues in the core and in the most used transports. This greatly improved the usability and consistency of Mule ESB, reducing friction points across the board. In particular, we recommend this upgrade to users who rely on JMS, CXF, HTTP and XSLT transformations.

On the MMC side, we focused on improving performance by as much as ten-fold for many deployments. We also worked on the communication among Mule servers to improve reliability and consistency.

== Migration

For instructions on migrating from a previous version, consult the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[Migration Guide].

== Limitations

* Currently, the Until-Successful router retries an operation until the operation succeeds; however, all retry attempts occur on just one node in the cluster
* The Mule ESB Enterprise Edition trial software cannot be used as a cluster node if you are also using it to evaluate the management console. Mulesoft recommends that you install the management console in a web container such as Apache Tomcat whenever you wish to manage cluster nodes

== Known Issues

The following JIRAs are open against this release of Mule ESB:
