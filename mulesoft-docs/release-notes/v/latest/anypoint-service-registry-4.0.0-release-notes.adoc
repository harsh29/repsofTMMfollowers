= Anypoint Service Registry 4.0.0 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, service registry

October 3, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the latest release of link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Service+Registry[Anypoint Service Registry], a multitenant service registry/repository and SOA governance tool. 

== Document Revision History

October 3, 2013, v.1.0 initial publication.

== New Features and Functionality

Version 4.0.0 of the Anypoint Service Registry agent introduces the following new features and upgraded functionality:

* *Service Auto-Discovery:* You can now configure your Mule Studio applications to be link:/documentation/display/current/Service+Auto-Discovery[automatically registered] by the Anypoint agent to your Anypoint Service Registry account. 
* *Streamlined policy and environment management:* The lists of link:/documentation/display/current/Runtime+Policy+Management[policies] and link:/documentation/display/current/Managing+Your+Organization+Settings[environments] now have "In Use" indicators. Policies and environments that are currently in use can now be deleted, resulting in a "batch unapply" functionality. 
* *Improved Search functionality:* The search tool in the web application now supports search by tags and taxonomies.
* *Support for additional endpoints:* You can now associate VM and JMS endpoints with a service, and use the service virtualization lookup method of invocation on these endpoints. Note that out-of-the-box policies are only supported on HTTP endpoints.
* *Backward Compatibility:* Older versions of the Anypoint Service Registry agent running on Mule ESB versions 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0, and 3.4.1 will continue to work without any action on behalf of users.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

Please refer to the detailed setup instructions in the link:/documentation/display/current/Integrating+API+Manager+with+Mule+ESB[setup guide for ESB on-premise] or the link:/documentation/display/current/Integrating+API+Manager+with+CloudHub[setup guide for CloudHub].

The Anypoint Service Registry application (https://anypoint.mulesoft.com) supports the following browsers:

* Firefox (latest version)
* Chrome (latest version)
* IE 9 (10 is preferred)

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

|===
|JIRA |Issue |Workaround
|STUDIO-3800 |Validation error when creating a global element for service auto discovery if serviceName attribute contains spaces |Enter serviceName attribute without spaces, then edit the name via the registry console or API after registration.
|HABITAT-1039 |Studio throws an error when you specify a <sr:service> global element without referencing it via <sr:auto-register-as>. |Comment out any auto-register-as global element configurations in your applications while they are not referenced in any endpoints.
|HABITAT-1037 |When creating contract-based throttling or rate-limiting policy, contract expression is shown and editable. |Do not edit the contract expression in this window. Instead, set the contract expression only on the contract enforcement policy.
|HABITAT-999 |Search cannot find services and consumers if name contains "-". |Omit special characters in the search tool.
|HABITAT-960 |Analytics incorrectly reports http requests received via a browser. |Calling endpoints via Postman, for example, results in correct tracking.
|HABITAT-247 |Once SLA tiers are defined for a service, the registry does not permit contracts unless a tier is selected. |Service owner can delete existing tiers, allow the contract to be requested while no tiers are defined, and then reinstate the tiers after the contract request has been made. Any contracts that were based on the tiers before their deletion will not be affected.
|HABITAT-333 a|
The registry does not recognize endpoints of http proxies using `inboundAddress` and `outboundAddress` elements.

 a|
Define a proxy using the following method:

|HABITAT-932 |Dynamic lookup invokes outbound endpoints using factory defaults; no customization or override of the defaults is possible. |None at this time. However, note that all HTTP outbound endpoints will be invoked using the POST method (which is the default for the HTTP protocol) and that overriding with a GET method is not currently supported.

== Migration Guide

If you have services registered on Anypoint Service Registry with an link:/documentation/display/current/API+Manager+Agent+Compatibility+Matrix[agent versions 117, 119, or 2.11.1] and migrate to the CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013) with the 4.0.0 Anypoint Service Registry agent, please be aware that within the element `<service-lookup>`, the attribute `serviceName` has changed to `serviceId`. Please update your consumer applications that are performing dynamic lookup and replace any instances of `serviceName` with `serviceId`.

In addition, the attribute `serviceRoundRobin` has been removed and replaced with a new element: `<dynamic-round-robin>`. Please update your consumer applications that were performing dynamic lookup to delete any references to the deprecated attribute. To enable round robin routing strategy, use the new <`dynamic-round-robin`> element instead.
