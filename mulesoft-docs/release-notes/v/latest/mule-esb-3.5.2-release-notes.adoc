== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases,  3.5.2 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by the 3.5.1 Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

Nothing was deprecated in the 3.5.2 Runtime.
