== Summary of Maintenance Fixes and Improvements

=== Mule ESB

This maintenance release focused primarily on resolving issues related to *JDBC*, *HTTP*, and *SEDA queues*. We fixed 65 issues, including over 40 critical issues (refer to *Fixed in This Release* for details). Further, we made the following four improvements:

* MULE-5940 - HTTP Transport needs support for PATCH method
* EE-2839 - Transport: JDBC - Retrieve the count for UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT
* MULE-6251 - Add a default object store for non internal usages
* MULE-6405 - Transport: HTTP(S)/Jetty - Transport exception mapping mechanism must extensible

=== Mule Management Console

This maintenance release resolved the issue with the agent certificate.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule ESB 3.2.3 does not change the hardware and software system requirements established in Mule ESB 3.2.2.

Please mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.
