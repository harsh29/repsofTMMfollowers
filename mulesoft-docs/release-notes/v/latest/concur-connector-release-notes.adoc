=== Concur 3.0 Fixed in this Release

=== Concur 3.0 Known Issues

- *Post Expense Report Submit Request* will not be able to submit reports that have been created with API V3. That is why we have removed this operation, until Concur fixes their issues.
- The same occurs with *Update Expense Entry Attendee* and *Delete Expense Entry Attendee*. Both will throw an Internal Server Error due to a Concur known issue.
