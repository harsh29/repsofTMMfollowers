:keywords: release notes, api manager

May 20, 2014

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the latest release of link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/[API Manager], a multitenant service and API registry/repository and governance tool, part of the link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes[Anypoint Platform for APIs previous release]. API Manager replaces and expands upon the offering formerly known as Anypoint Service Registry.

[NOTE]
Note that as of July 28, 2014, the URL at which API Manager is available has changed to *http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apimanager[anypoint.mulesoft.com/apimanager].*

== Document Revision History

*May 20, 2014*, v.1.0 initial publication.

*July 29, 2014*, v.1.1 revision to reflect new URL for product access.

== New Features and Functionality

*Version 6.0.0* of the API Manager agent introduced the following new features and upgraded functionality:

* *GA support for the policies and functionality introduced with Agent version 5.0.2, released with 3.5.0-M4 Early Access runtime.*
* *Performance Improvements for Contract-Based Policies.*
* *Support for endpoints inside Poll scopes.*
* *Improvements to OAuth 2.0 enforcement behavior.*
* *Backward Compatibility:* Older versions of the API Manager agent running on Mule ESB versions 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0, 3.4.1, and 3.4.2 will continue to work without any action on behalf of users

In addition, we have deprecated the Service Virtualization feature, along with the Mule elements `dynamic-first-successful`, `dynamic-round-robin`, and `dynamic-all`. Note that dynamic endpoint lookup is still possible using the API Manager REST API. 

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

Please refer to the detailed setup instructions in the link:/documentation/display/current/Integrating+API+Manager+with+Your+APIs+and+Services[setup guide].

The API Manager application (http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apimanager[anypoint.mulesoft.com/apimanager]) supports the following browsers:

* Firefox (latest version)
* Chrome (latest version)
* IE 10

|===
|JIRA |Issue |Workaround
|HABITAT-247 |Once SLA tiers are defined for a service, the registry does not permit contracts unless a tier is selected. |Service owner can delete existing tiers, allow the contract to be requested while no tiers are defined, and then reinstate the tiers after the contract request has been made. Any contracts that were based on the tiers before their deletion will not be affected.
|HABITAT-333 a|
The registry does not recognize endpoints of http proxies using `inboundAddress` and `outboundAddress` elements.

 a|
Define a proxy using the following method:

|HABITAT-932 |Dynamic lookup invokes outbound endpoints using factory defaults; no customization or override of the defaults is possible. |None at this time. However, note that all HTTP outbound endpoints will be invoked using the POST method (which is the default for the HTTP protocol) and that overriding with a GET method is not currently supported.
|HABITAT-960 |Analytics incorrectly reports http requests received via a browser. |Calling endpoints via Postman, for example, results in correct tracking.
|HABITAT-999 |Search cannot find services and consumers if name contains "-". |Omit special characters in the search tool.
|HABITAT-1037 |When creating contract-based throttling or rate-limiting policy, contract expression is shown and editable. |Do not edit the contract expression in this window. Instead, set the contract expression only on the contract enforcement policy.
|HABITAT-1039 |Studio throws an error when you specify a <sr:service> global element without referencing it via <sr:auto-register-as>. |Comment out any auto-register-as global element configurations in your applications while they are not referenced in any endpoints.
|HABITAT-1056 |Rate Limiting Policy cannot be removed once the max limit of calls is performed. |Wait until the time period for the max limit expires, then unapply the policy.
|HABITAT-1058 |When changing the name of a service/consumer using invalid characters, there is no error message. | 
|HABITAT-1068 |When a policy is applied at endpoint level, if the endpoint is deleted, policy characteristics displayed on service panel are not updated. | 
|HABITAT-1154 |On Internet Explorer, deleting a policy takes more than one minute. | 
|HABITAT-1159 |Contract-based policies should not show the default contract expression on the API. | 
|HABITAT-1162 |Autodiscovery exception thrown if application has no endpoints associated to a service. | 
|HABITAT-1176 |Incorrect security provider applied when switching provider policies within the same operation. |Unapply a security provider policy, hit the endpoint, then apply the new security provider policy.
|HABITAT-1198 |On a service, if localhost:8081 is already defined, system does not allow a new endpoint creation using it even if an alias is provided.  | 
|HABITAT-1203 |When calling working but not yet tracked endpoint, stacktrace is generated. | 
|HABITAT-1204 |Applying and unapplying rate limit policy does not clear correctly policy rate limit values.  | 
|HABITAT-1207 |When declaring a service without endpoints using autodiscovery, no endpoint is tracked.  | 
|HABITAT-1223 |On Service details, infinite applying animation is displayed when applying twice a nested policy.  | 
|HABITAT-1230 |Consumer Key based policy can be applied when contract enforcement by contract key is used. | 
|HABITAT-1231 |On consumers, after revoking a contract, page is not refreshed.  | 
|HABITAT-1232 |On service, service details, it is not possible to revoke a contract. |Revoke contract from Contracts screen.
|HABITAT-1233 |When creating a service, some of the declared endpoints are discarded. |After exiting the service creation wizard, add additional endpoints as needed.
