== New Features

This release provides a new configuration wizard that lets you easily generate connectors with supported features and components.

* Supported components are: +
** `@Connector`
** `@Handler`
** `@Configuration`
** `@MetaDataCategory`
** `@OAuth2`
** `@ConnectionManagement`
** `ProviderPagingAwareDelegate`
* The only name not valid aside from the ones supported for Java Names, is a name that matches the component used.Example: If you are creating an **@Handler**, your class name cannot be *Handler*.
* All classes have the SuperClass and Interface enabled and can be used, but `ProviderPaginAwareDelegate` cannot specify a parent class, since the generated class needs to extend this one.
* Connector Type auto-populates for ProviderPagingAwareDelegate, ensure that you specify the collection type after creating it.
* When an interface is selected, it generates the default implementation for every component. This is resolved by the platform, there is no custom code from our side.
