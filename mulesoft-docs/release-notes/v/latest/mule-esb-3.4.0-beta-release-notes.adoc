_Beta_



[NOTE]
As a *Beta release,* Mule ESB 3.4.0 is not intended for use in production environments.

February 20, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta** which introduces exciting new functionality and improvements to our industry-leading ESB software.

These release notes apply to both the Community and the Enterprise editions of Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta. Where appropriate, we have applied an *_Enterprise Edition_* marker to identify features or functionality that are available only in the Enterprise Edition.

For this release, we have focused our efforts on features and tools that improve developer productivity and make SaaS integration even easier.  Our new version of Studio now functions as a single download, enabling developers to switch between Community and Enterprise Edition runtimes.  We also continue to harden our product, making it more stable and easier to use as we apply bug fixes and improvements. 

http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Download Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta] to test drive our newly released features. We welcome your mailto:beta@mulesoft.com[feedback]! +
(Note that as a *Beta release*, Mule ESB 3.4.0 is not intended for use in production environments.)

== New Features and Functionality

* *Visual Flow Debugger*: Enables users to insert breakpoints in flows, step through breakpoints in the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/studio-visual-debugger[visual debugger], and examine message content as it moves through the flow.  Remote debugging is also supported.
* *Anypoint DataMapper Enhancements*: _*Enterprise Edition *_Includes the ability to use information from other flows directly in mapping, the ability to modify your input/output without losing mappings, and the support for the Mule Expression Language directly within the DataMapper transformation logic. Refer to the chapter of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[Anypoint DataMapper documentation] for more detail.
* *Studio as an Eclipse Distribution*: Studio is available as a Eclipse plugin package distribution. User can now leverage Studio with Eclipse 3.8-based IDEs, including Spring Tool Suite (STS).  We support the Java, Java EE, and STS 3.1.0 distributions that use Eclipse 3.8. 
* *Studio Documentation Generation*: Studio provides the ability to generate HTML-based documentation for a project. These materials contain the diagram and XML for flows and the description of flows and their components as entered by developers within the application.
* **Metadata-Based Development**: This link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/adding-datasense[feature] automatically discovers the operation data types for several connectors so as to prescribe mapping within a DataMapper Transformer. You no longer have to explore the documentation of your connectors and the description of their underlying APIs in order to be able understand their data types – they will automatically be discovered and shown in Studio.
* *Maven support*: Enhancements to make it easier for users to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/mule-and-maven[create and run Maven] projects directly in Studio. Further, Studio automatically maintains all dependencies. Users can link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/converting-maven-into-studio[import] Maven projects into Studio, or link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/converting-studio-into-maven[export] them as needed. 

== Noteworthy Improvements

* *Eclipse upgrade*: Studio uses version Eclipse 3.8.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule ESB 3.3.X.  

Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta. Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted.

=== Mule ESB

[cols="",]
|===
|MULE-6639 |JSON to Object Transformer secondary thread changing payload type in studio with debugger
|MULE-6627                        |MEL errors are not descriptive
|MULE-6612                        |Core exports unnecessary transient dependency to junit
|MULE-6608                                |MEL does not provide root exceptions
|MULE-6583        |Fix thread context classloader in HttpRequestDispatcher
|===

=== Mule Studio

*Maven Support*  

* Studio automatically manages Maven project dependencies (i.e. updates the `pom.xml` file) _only for Anypoint Connectors_, not for all the elements in the palette. To update the dependencies of any other element in your Maven project in Studio, open and edit the `pom.xml` file manually. 
* At present, you cannot add parameters to the `run mvn` execution.  

*DataSense*

* The Anypoint connectors that come bundled with the Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta distribution cannot be uninstalled.
* With this Beta release, operation metadata is not cached on disk; the information is only valid for a single Studio session.  Therefore, when you close a session of Studio, you lose the metadata your connection-tested connector collected.  To revise a mapping in a new Studio session, configure the connector again, then reacquire the resource's metadata.

*Mule Visual Debugger*

* Studio allows you to modify the inbound properties of events within the debugger,  but this feature is not yet functional.

== Third Party Connectors and other modules

At this time, not all of the third party modules you may have been using with previous versions of Mule ESB have been upgraded to work with Mule ESB 3.4.0 Beta. mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific module.

== Migrating from Mule ESB 3.3.X to 3.4.0 Beta

The following sub-sections offer details on the changed and improved behaviors that Mule ESB 3.4.0 introduces. For more details on how to migrate from previous versions of Mule ESB, access the Migration Guides embedded in previous link:/release-notes[Release Notes] or the link:/release-notes/legacy-mule-migration-notes[archive of Migration Guides].

==== Maven and Connectors

When working with a Maven project in Studio, Mule seamlessly and automatically updates all Anypoint Connector dependencies. This dependency support ensures that any connectors you use in your flows always have the correct dependencies updated for Maven. We recommend updating any connectors you may use in your Mule applications to the latest versions to ensure that your connectors, and their dependencies, are all up-to-date.

However, if you prefer to continue using older versions of connectors in your Maven project in Studio, you can disable Maven support in Studio, which also disables the automatic updates of connector dependencies. Contact mailto:support@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Support] for more details about how to disable Maven to maintain the use of older connectors.
