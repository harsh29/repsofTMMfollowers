=== Migrating From an Older Version to Version 7.0.0

More changes have been made to metadata, thus when you upgrade to NetSuite Connector 7.0.0, reload metadata during design time.

In this release we now use SuiteTalk API version 2015.2 for our web services. In this version NetSuite introduced a new concept called an "Integration Record". This requires the use of an application Id. Hence all three connection strategy configurations now have a new parameter called `applicationId`.
The Integration Record containing an application Id can be set up from within your NetSuite environment by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration* > *Manage Integrations*. The global elements will now look as follows:

New Global Configurations (from version 7.0.0):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:config-login-authentication name="NetSuite" email="${email}" password="${password}" account="${account}" roleId="${roleId}" applicationId="${applicationId}" />

<netsuite:config-request-level-authentication name="NetSuite" email="${email}" password="${password}" account="${account}" roleId="${roleId}" applicationId="${applicationId}" />

<netsuite:config-sso-login-authentication name="NetSuite" email="${email}" password="${password}" account="${account}" roleId="${roleId}" applicationId="${applicationId}" />
----

Configuration for `getRecord` and `getCustomRecord` has slightly changed due to the DataSense introduction. Also, the `@Default` is now set on the `internalId` with a default value of `#[payload]`.

Configuration prior to 7.0.0:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:get-record config-ref="">
	<netsuite:record-ref internalId="" externalId="" type="" />
</netsuite:get-record>
----

New configuration (from version 7.0.0):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:get-record config-ref="" internalId="" externalId="" type="" />
----

Due to the addition of pagination to search we have removed the now redundant processors `searchNext`, `searchMore` and `searchMoreWithId`.

Furthermore, we would like to unify search functionality under just one processor and we feel that with the improvements made so far and the growing use of DataWeave, *`search`* should be the go-to operation. Moreover, `searchWithExpression` and `query` operations are limited when it comes to certain complexities. Hence we have decided to remove the processors `searchWithExpression`, `queryAsNativeResult` and `queryRecords`.

*`search`* will now always return the whole set of results rather than just the first page. This is will be retrieved in the form of a List of Maps that represent all the records found that match your criteria. A new parameter fetchSize can be set to control the page size used by pagination support.

Here is an example of how the configuration for `search` will look:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" searchRecord="EMPLOYEE_BASIC" criteria-ref="#[payload]" fetchSize="5" />
----

Here are some examples if you are switching from `searchWithExpression` or `query`. The criteria for search can easily be constructed using DataWeave, generating the script for you and requiring you only to fill in the values (you can also use a Java component or DataMapper should you prefer).

* `searchWithExpression` to `search`:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:search-with-expression config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" searchRecord="EMPLOYEE_BASIC" expression="is(email, '#[map-payload:email]'), contains(address, '#[map-payload:address]')"/>
----
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dw:transform-message doc:name="Transform Message">
	<dw:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	email: {
		operator: "IS",
		searchValue: payload.email
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchStringField"
	}
	address: {
		operator: "CONTAINS",
		searchValue: payload.address
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchStringField"
	}
} as :object {
	class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.common.EmployeeSearchBasic"
}]]></dw:set-payload>
</dw:transform-message>
<netsuite:search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" searchRecord="EMPLOYEE_BASIC" fetchSize="50" doc:name="NetSuite"/>
----

* `query` to `search`:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:query-records config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" query="dsql:SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE firstName=#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.firstName]" fetchSize="50" doc:name="Query EMPLOYEE record"/>
----
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dw:transform-message doc:name="Transform Message">
	<dw:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	firstName: {
		operator: "IS",
		searchValue: inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.firstName
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchStringField"
	}
} as :object {
	class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.common.EmployeeSearchBasic"
}]]></dw:set-payload>
</dw:transform-message>
<netsuite:search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" searchRecord="EMPLOYEE_BASIC" fetchSize="50" doc:name="NetSuite"/>
----

Finally, `getDeletedRecords` has also been reworked. This operation will now expect a `SearchDateField` on the payload as its `@Default` value, together with a pageIndex and type as before. The `SearchDateField` can also be manually defined. Here are some examples:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<netsuite:get-deleted-records config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" type="ACCOUNT">
    <netsuite:deleted-date ref="#[payload]"/>
</netsuite:get-deleted-records>

<netsuite:get-deleted-records config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" type="EMPLOYEE">
    <netsuite:deleted-date operator="ON" searchValue="#[java.util.Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar(); calendar.set(2015, 10, 01); return calendar;]"/>
</netsuite:get-deleted-records>

<netsuite:get-deleted-records config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication" type="CUSTOMER" doc:name="NetSuite">
    <netsuite:deleted-date operator="BEFORE" predefinedSearchValue="THIS_MONTH"/>
</netsuite:get-deleted-records>
----
