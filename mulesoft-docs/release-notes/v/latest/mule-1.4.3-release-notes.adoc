= Mule 1.4.3 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb


The Mule Team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.4.3. Please note, this is a maintenance release addressing an important JMS problem as outlined in http://mule.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-2324[MULE-2324]. We felt strong about providing an immediate release because many of our users rely on the JMS transport.

Thanks a lot to the community providing us with valuable feedback and allowing us to respond quickly.
