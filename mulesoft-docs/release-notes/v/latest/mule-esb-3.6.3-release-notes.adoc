=== Migration Guide

MULE-8571 also introduced hostname validation in the HTTP requester since the upgrade included the fix for link:https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197[this] async-http-client security vulnerability. This means that seemingly valid certificates for HTTPS connections in older versions could now be rejected if they contain no Subject Alternative Name extension matching the host of the request.

|MULE-8645|jasper-jdt-6.0.29 is not included any more in Mule distributions because of detected vulnerabilities. If this artifact is needed, such as when using Drools, then manually add it in the `<MULE_HOME>/lib/opt` directory.
