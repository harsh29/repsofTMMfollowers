== Entitlements Support

Your Anypoint Platform account must own the necessary entitlements to be able to access the DataGateway Designer in Salesforce. If you're not able to access the designer, make sure that your contract with Mulesoft includes these entitlements. If it doesn't, you can file a ticket in the link:/anypoint-platform-administration/community-and-support[support portal].
If you own a trial account, keep in mind that this trial licence expires after a given period of time. Once this trial period has expired, you won't be able to access the DataGateway Designer either.


== Known Issues

** Available External Data Source licenses within Lightning Connect

* Gateway creation and deployment can take up to 2 minutes, due to the volume of provisioning that occurs in the background of this application. A loading message will persist throughout this process
