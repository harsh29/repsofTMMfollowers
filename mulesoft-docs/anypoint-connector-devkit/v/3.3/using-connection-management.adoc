= Using Connection Management

Connection management is a way for a *Cloud Connector* to interact with an external entity to authorize a series of actions. The external entity requires a username and password on first connection, then returns an access token for the connector to use for subsequent interactions. The connector preserves the access token between calls. *Mule DevKit* supports retrying unsuccessful connections and refreshing access tokens.

== Reconnection Strategies

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/configuring-reconnection-strategies[Configuring Reconnection Strategies] provides a detailed description of how to specify parameters for retrying unsuccessful operations. In Mule DevKit 3.3, any connector using connection management can use these techniques.
