# Contribution Guidelines

Unfortunately, not every user script can be considered. The aim of the list is to provide a concise list of noteworthy user scripts and that fill a gap.


Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased. 
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
